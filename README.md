## RFD's notes
To-do on the technical side that all 3 of you need to do:  
- create a free Github account and share the link in the conversation  
- download Github Desktop and make sure your account is linked to it (a bit like Discord App, I guess)  
- clone this repo  
  
Do not try to upload stuff until we set that up (it'd be a hassle).  
  
Asset guidelines, etc. should probably go here.
