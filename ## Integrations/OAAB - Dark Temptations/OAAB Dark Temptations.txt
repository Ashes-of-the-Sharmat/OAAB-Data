OAAB Dark Temptations
by OperatorJack

"Oh, a parting gift for your troubles. An agent of madness to summon to your side. Go and spread Sheogorath's gift wherever you wander." - Sheogorath

This mod adds a "Summon Dark Seducer" spell as an additional quest reward for the Sheogorath quest (DA_Sheogorath). You will receive the spell upon completion of the quest (Journal Index 70). 

This mod requires OAAB_Data, MWSE, and Magicka Expanded 00 - Framework.
