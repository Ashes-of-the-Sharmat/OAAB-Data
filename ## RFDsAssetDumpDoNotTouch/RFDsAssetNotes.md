WIP stuff, mostly.  
  
Cave - some stuff fucked up; mostly gridsnaps; textures by Cabal with my edits; set heavily relies on texture blending  
M-E - most effects are garbage and/or halve FPS, need nuking/serious rework - fire mesh is badly fucked up; tomes are almost ready to be merged  
Underwater - some kollops need replacement, particularly the smooth ones; other stuff needs work too  
Farmtool - collars need more vcol and less texture shading  
Shrooms - extremely WIP, no texturing done yet  
MMM2019 - Dwemer stuff, Velothi stuff, broken glass claymore
