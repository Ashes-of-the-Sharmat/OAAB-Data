Below is a list of apparatus available. These can be found of varying quality; the better the quality, the better your potions will be. A mortar and pestle is required for all potion making. The other tools are optional, but you will get better results if you have one of each at your disposal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Mortar and Pestle</FONT><BR>\r\nThis is the most basic apparatus required to mix a potion. Your mortar and pestle's quality also determines the potion's strength. This simple apparatus is a must for any alchemist. To use, simply add your ingredients to the mortar, and stir or grind your ingredients with the pestle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Retort</FONT><BR>\r\nA retort is a basic distillation device used to increase the magnitude and duration of all positive effects in a potion. To use, place the ingredient, preferably in liquid form, in the bulb of the alembic, and heat with a small flame. In time, the distilled ingredient will collect and travel down the spout. This simple process requires little tending, just make sure you have plenty flasks at the ready.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Alembic</FONT><BR>\r\nThe alembic is used to decrease the magnitude and duration of all negative effects in a potion. This tool is necessary if you're forced to work with ingredients that combine negative effects, but unnecessary if there are none. Skooma pipes also make good alembics. The alembic is a distillation apparatus similar to the retort, but instead of one bulb, it has two or three bulbs connected by a tube.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Calcinator</FONT><BR>\r\nThe calcinator increases the magnitude and duration of all effects in a potion. Calcination is the process of heating a substance to just below its melting point. It is often used to drive off water or other volatile constituents, or to oxidize or reduce a substance. Careful experimentation will reveal how much heat and time is required for each ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGeneral Practice<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe easiest way for a beginner to practice alchemy is to sample ingredients. Of course, your skills will grow faster if you successfully mix a potion, but your failure rate will be high until you gain experience. It is best to have basic training before attempting your first potions, otherwise you'll be fumbling blind, and gain little experience in the art. Once you have the basic skills, you can increase your chance of success by fortifying intelligence and luck, allowing even the low skilled to become successful alchemists. Here are two simple recipes for these purposes:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Intelligence</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR><FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\">\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThese ingredients are common and inexpensive in Vvardenfell, and drinking this potion will take your alchemy to new heights.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Luck</FONT><BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nCorprus Weepings<BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCorkbulb root and guar hide are both inexpensive and readily available. Corprus weepings may also be used, but are difficult -- and dangerous -- to obtain.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAny two ingredients with similar effect can be used to create a potion; however, some are better combinations than others. Potions effects do not multiply if you use more than two ingredients with the same effect. Multiple effects do occur however if your ingredients combine in more than one way. An alchemist must be wary of combining negative effects, which may spoil a potion if not filtered out with a quality alembic.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs you experiment, you may notice a difference in weight between one potion and another. Potion weight is determined by the mean weight of ingredients mixed. To obtain lighter potions, when only two heavy ingredients of the right combination are available, you can mix in lighter, neutral ingredients to reduce the potion's weight. Adding a cheaper, more available ingredient such as saltrice can lighten your potions, unless of course it happens to add a negative effect to the potion you're trying to make.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYou may find through your experiments that using the lightest ingredients possible will sometimes net you zero weight. This factor seems to be entirely up to chance. Believe me, I've tried fortifying my luck in the hopes of making this happen, and it doesn't always work. Still, it is quite the happy accident when it does happen.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBasic Potions<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Health</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMany readily available ingredients can be combined to make this essential potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow<BR>\r\nWickwheat<BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nResin<BR>\r\nEmerald<BR>\r\nCorprus Weepings<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nSaltrice, marshmarrow, wickwheat, and corkbulb root are lightweight and inexpensive, so they are the best choices. Resin, emeralds and corprus weepings produce the same effect, but are rarer and more expensive, so they are better saved for other potions. Beware of mixing marshmarrow and corprus weepings, since it will spoil the potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Fatigue</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is the easiest potion to make, as numerous ingredients produce this effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\nHackle-Lo Leaf<BR>\r\nChokeweed<BR>\r\nScrib Jerky<BR>\r\nScuttle<BR>\r\nBread<BR>\r\nSmall and Large Kwama Eggs<BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThe best, most lightweight ingredients are saltrice, hackle-lo leaf, chokeweed, scrib jerky, and scuttle. Heavier ingredients include bread, kwama eggs (small and large), crab meat, and hound meat. All these ingredients are readily available. Beware of bad combinations, as mixing large kwama eggs with hackle-lo leaf will create an unwanted paralyze effect and spoil your potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeavier ingredients may not be the best, but though you may not want to lug these around, they are great fodder for practice potions. Both bread and small kwama eggs have no other effect, so it is the best way to use them up and gain skill. You can also make easy coin selling them to vendors.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Magicka</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe ingredients for this potion are a more difficult to obtain, with the exception of comberry, but it is certainly worth the trouble. The ingredients that will produce this effect are:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\nDaedra's Heart<BR>\r\nFrost Salts<BR>\r\nVoid Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThis potion is perhaps best left until you have some experience, as most ingredients are expensive and difficult to obtain. Comberry, found throughout the Ascasdian Isles, is common and inexpensive. All other ingredients -- Daedra's heart, frost salts, and void salts -- are more difficult to come by, and dangerous to hunt for. Nevertheless, this potion is one of the most useful you can make if you happen to use magic.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAny potion you make, even at a beginner's level, will be worth more than the ingredients themselves, so long as you choose them wisely. A shrewd alchemist has the potential to make quite a lot of money. There are many ingredients ripe and ready for the picking throughout Vvardenfell, and each potion you make will get you a little further, and a little richer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese basic potions will get you through your early experiments with alchemy. As you gain skill, you will learn more effects for the ingredients you have. With experimentation and experience, soon you'll be making potions to match the master alchemists themselves.<BR>"

They work instantly, are 100% effective, and are often more cost effective than similar spells. This first volume lists the five cure potions that can be created by the home alchemist.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Blight Disease</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is possibly the most important potion in Vvardenfell, as the blight has touched even the remotest corners of the land. A cure blight potion is a must for any adventurer, and costs far less than a spell of similar effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo cure blight, mix any two of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Salts<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAsh salts and scrib jelly are common ingredients, reasonably priced at most alchemists. Ash salts can also be obtained from ash ghouls, though it is not recommended you go hunting Red Mountain for them. Scrib jelly comes from scribs, a passive animal that is easy to kill. However, watch out for the blighted ones, or you may need this potion sooner than you think.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Common Disease</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother useful potion that can be made by mixing any two of the following ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nChokeweed<BR>\r\nGravedust<BR>\r\nGreen Lichen<BR>\r\nMuck<BR>\r\nRed Lichen<BR>\r\nWillow Anther<BR>\r\nDaedra Skin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt it not recommended to mix muck with either gravedust or willow anther, since it will spoil the potion. Gravedust does not go well with red lichen either.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAll ingredients listed are lightweight and fairly easy to obtain, with the exception of daedra skin, which is expensive and only available at fine alchemists.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Paralyzation</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is not only useful for adventuring, but can also counter potions that have an unwanted paralyze effect. Four common ingredients can be used to cure paralyzation:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\nScamp Skin<BR>\r\nWillow Anther<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt is not recommended to mix netch leather with willow anther, as it will produce a negative effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorkbulb root and willow anther grows in the Ascadian Isles region. You'll have to hunt netches or scamps to get their hides, which is not recommended for the novice adventurer. These ingredients are inexpensive and available in most alchemy shops.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Poison</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is essential if you happen to be hunting bull netches for their leather. Many ingredients produce this effect, so it can be made by mixing the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Lichen<BR>\r\nGhoul Heart<BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\nRat Meat<BR>\r\nRaw Ebony<BR>\r\nRoobrush<BR>\r\nScathecraw<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt is not recommended to mix scathecraw with either roobrush or black lichen. However, mixing scathecraw with scrib jelly or meteor slime will also produce a potion to restore willpower. Rat meat and ghoul heart have an added paralysis effect, so mixing them is not recommended unless you have a good quality alembic to filter out the effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt is important to keep track of the weight of your ingredients when making potions. For example, rat meat and raw ebony are heavy ingredients, so mixing these will produce a heavier potion that will encumber a traveler.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMost ingredients listed are fairly easy to obtain, with the exception of meteor slime, which is difficult to find. (Just a hint -- the bookseller Jobasha might know, but don't bother asking him about it.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes the first chapter of the Alchemists Compendium. Part II will continue with Recipes of restoration. Until then, dear reader and fellow alchemist, happy mixing.<BR>"

Unfortunately, these homemade potions have a duration, which is unwanted in this case. When suffering a curse, it is better to buy potions of similar effect that have no duration to cure what ails you for good.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Agility</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnly two available ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBonemeal<BR>\r\nSload Soap<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nBoth these ingredients are fairly common. However, sload soap is relatively expensive because it is imported from the Black Marsh. It can be found at most fine alchemists. Bonemeal is found at grave sites on skeletons, undead or otherwise.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Endurance</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTwo simple ingredients can be combined to make this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nGravedust<BR>\r\nScales<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nGravedust can be found in most fine alchemists. Scales are found on slaughterfish, large or small. They are not difficult to find; just walk into the water, anywhere near Vvardenfell. Trust me, they will come.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Intelligence</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made by combining any two of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBittergreen Petals (treated or otherwise)<BR>\r\nRuby<BR>\r\nScrap Metal<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThis potion is somewhat frustrating to make as the ingredients, aside from bittergreen petals, are difficult to obtain. Scrap metal can be found plundering Dwemer ruins, but it is incredibly heavy, so lugging it out of these dangerous fortresses is almost as difficult as dissasembling Dwemer centurions. Due to its weight, it makes heavy potions, which is not ideal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCombining rubies and scrap metal will also create a negative effect, so it is not recommended. The best combination is rubies and bittergreen petals. Though rubies are expensive, they are lightweight and easier to obtain than scrap metal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Luck</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThree readily available ingredients can be used to produce this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nHackle-Lo Leaf<BR>\r\nKresh Fiber<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining crab meat and hack-lo leaf will also restore fatigue, though the potion will be heavier than combining hackle-lo leaf and kresh fiber.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Personality</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo create this potion, any two of the following ingredients are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\nHeather<BR>\r\nScamp Skin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from any of these combined, but guar hide will leave you with a heavier potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Strength</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough this potion uses fairly common ingredients, you must beware when mixing them:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDreugh Wax<BR>\r\nGold Kanet<BR>\r\nRoland's Tear<BR>\r\nScamp Skin<BR>\r\nStoneflower Petals<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nMixing either gold kanet, Roland's tear (a type of gold kanet), dreugh wax, or stoneflower petals will result in a drain luck effect. These ingredients should be combined with scamp skin instead, whenever possible.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Speed</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can only be made with the following two ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nResin<BR>\r\nRaw Ebony<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt is unfortunate that raw ebony is both expensive and heavy. Resin can be bought from a few select alchemists and vendors, so it is not common either.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Willpower</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made by combining:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\nScathecraw<BR>\r\nTrama Root<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining scathecraw with scrib jelly or meteor slime will also cure poison. Combining meteor slime with scrib jelly will cure poison and fortify willpower as well. However, meteor slime is a rare ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis concludes the second chapter of the Alchemists Compendium. The next installation will deal with recipes of fortfication. Until then, dear fellow alchemists, happy mixing.<BR>"

Combining the former two ingredients or roobrush is not recommended, because it will poison the potion. These three ingredients must be combined with sload soap instead. Combining sload soap with fire salts will also create a potion of fire shield.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Endurance</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion works well in combination with fortify speed. Three possible ingredients can be combined to make this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDaedra's Heart<BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAll three ingredients will produce a heavy potion, so mixing them with some lighter, neutral ingredients is recommended if you intend to use potion for traveling.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Intelligence</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis useful potion is a must for alchemists and enchanters alike. It can be made by combining any two of the following readily available ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAsh yams are abundant in Vvardenfell, so it is perhaps best combined with the other ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Luck</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis, like the previous recipe, will help enhance your alchemy or enchanting abilities. It can be made using the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nCorprus Weepings<BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCorkbulb root and guar hide are common ingredients, therefore the easiest combination for this recipe. Combining guar hide with corprus weepings will spoil the potion. However, combining corprus weepings with corkbulb root will also create a potion of restore health.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Personality</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA must when bargaining for more expensive alchemy ingredients. To create this potion, any two of the following are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nGreen Lichen<BR>\r\nKresh Fiber<BR>\r\nStoneflower Petals<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients, and all are easy to obtain.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Strength</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be created with the following ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nDaedra Skin<BR>\r\nDreugh Wax<BR>\r\nVampire Dust<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients. Ash yams and dreugh wax are the more abundant of the four, therefore the most likely choice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Speed</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGreat for traveling on foot, or getting out of a fight, this potion can be made with the following three ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nKagouti Hide<BR>\r\nMoon Sugar<BR>\r\nShalk Resin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nBe aware that combining kagouti hide with shalk resin will spoil the potion. Unfortunately, moon sugar trade is illegal in Morrowind, so it may be difficult to obtain.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Willpower</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made using any two of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\nWickwheat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining meteor slime with scrib jelly will cure poison and fortify willpower as well.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: Other Fortification Recipes\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Fatigue</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis not only fortifies, but restores as well. This wonderful dual purpose potion can be made by combining:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\nScrib Jerky<BR>\r\nScuttle<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nScrib jerky and scuttle produce a much lighter potion than combining either with hound meat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Health</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is incredibly handy, but unfortunately doesn't have the best combinations of ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHuman Flesh<BR>\r\nLarge Kwama Egg<BR>\r\nShalk Resin<BR>\r\nVampire Dust<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nNever combine shalk resin with human flesh. Scuttle and vampire dust is the optimal combination, but is expensive. The easiest combination is shalk resin with a large kwama egg. This creates a heavy potion, but the weight can be leveled out by adding lighter, neutral ingredients. Depending on which neutral ingredients you choose, this can also produce extra effects.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCombining a large kwama egg with a light restore health ingredient such as saltrice, marshmarrow, or wickwheat will create a potion that restores health at the same time. The more light ingredients you add to the potion, the lighter your potion will be, so what the heck, add two.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Magicka</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made by combining two of these three ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nEmerald<BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\nStoneflower Petals<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining emeralds with saltrice will have the added benefit of restoring heath.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis concludes the third chapter of the Alchemists Compendium. The next installation will deal with recipes of resistance and shielding. Until then, dear fellow alchemists, happy mixing.<BR>"

Three possible ingredients can be combined to make this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAlit Hide<BR>\r\nKwama Cuttle<BR>\r\nRat Meat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAny of these three ingredients will produce a heavy potion, so mixing them with lighter, neutral ingredients is recommended if you intend to use this potion for traveling. Combining rat meat with kwama cuttle, and a lighter cure poison ingredient such as scrib jelly will not only lighten your potion, but create a potion that cures poison as well. The key is to use rat meat, which produces both effects. Kwama cuttle was chosen because it is lighter than alit hide.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Fire</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made using the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Anther<BR>\r\nFire Petal<BR>\r\nFrost Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Frost</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnly two ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Lichen<BR>\r\nFire Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Shock</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is another wonderful dual purpose potion, creating a lightning shield as well. To mix this potion, the two following ingredients are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nScrap Metal<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThis potion is incredibly heavy, so you may want to add lighter, neutral ingredients to it. Adding an ingredient such as saltrice will also add the benefit of restore fatigue. Combine that with marshmarrow or wickwheat, and you have an even lighter potion that restores health as well, for little added cost. Get creative!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: Recipes of Shield Potions<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fire Shield</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following will produce the desired effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\nFire Salts<BR>\r\nRaw Glass<BR>\r\nSload Soap<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining fire salts and sload soap will also create a potion of fortify agility. Raw glass is heavy, and fire shield is the only positive effect you can create with it. It is also expensive, so it is better bartered for more useful ingredients than used in home alchemy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Frost Shield</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following will produce the desired effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nFrost Salts<BR>\r\nLarge Kwama Egg<BR>\r\nRaw Ebony<BR>\r\nWillow Anther<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects by combining any of these ingredients. However, both kwama eggs and raw ebony are heavy, therefore not the best combination.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Lightning Shield</FONT><BR>\r\nThe following ingredients produce the desired effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nScrap Metal<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAside from crab meat and scrap metal, which is also used in the shock resistance potion mentioned in the first section, corkbulb root can also be used to create a plain lightning shield potion without the added effect. It produces a lighter potion if scrap metal is not used.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes the fourth chapter of the Alchemists Compendium. The final installation will deal with recipes of magical effect. Until then, dear fellow alchemists, happy mixing.<BR>"

This compendium only deals with potions of positive effect, but harmful potions can also be made within the same schools of magic, such as burden or paralyze.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: Potions of Alteration<BR><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Feather</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFeather will make your burdens lighter, and your ruin raiding much brighter. The following three ingredients can be combined to produce this effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHeather<BR>\r\nRuby<BR>\r\nScuttle<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Levitate</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is a must for any Telvanni sorcerer, and can be made with any of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCoda Flower<BR>\r\nRacer Plumes<BR>\r\nTrama Root<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAny combination of these ingredients will result in excellent potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Swift Swim</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA most excellent potion for pearl diving, it can be made using the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDaedra Skin<BR>\r\nScales<BR>\r\nScrib Jerky<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nScales and scrib jerky are the most common combination because they are more readily available ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Water Breathing</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother must for you pearl divers out there. Four possible ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHackle-Lo Leaf<BR>\r\nKwama Cuttle<BR>\r\nLuminous Russula<BR>\r\nPearl<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nLuminous russula and kwama cuttle are not a good combination and will spoil your potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Water Walking</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion will save your life when the slaughterfish become too much for you. To create this potion, two of the four following ingredients are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAmpoule Pod<BR>\r\nKwama Cuttle<BR>\r\nScales<BR>\r\nViolet Coprinus<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nKwama cuttle will create a spoiled potion with violet coprinus, as it does with luminous russula.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: Potions of Illusion<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Invisibility</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is not the best potion for thievery, as some have suggested, but for casual sneaking it will do. Only two possible ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBittergreen Petals (also treated Bittergreen Petals)<BR>\r\nDiamond<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Light</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion's effect is different from the spell; because it only works on the imbiber, it is similar to night eye. Only two ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Anther<BR>\r\nRed Lichen<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Night Eye</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor seeing in the dark, of course. The two ingredients that can create this potion are:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDaedra's Heart<BR>\r\nKagouti Hide<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nSeeing as daedra's heart is difficult to obtain, a potion of light may be a better choice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Three: Potions of Mysticism\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Detect Animal</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf you don't have a potion of night eye (or light) on you, this potion will help you avoid stepping on rats as you explore dark caves. You may use a combination of four possible ingredients to create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAlit Hide<BR>\r\nAmpoule Pod<BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nEctoplasm<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from any combination of these ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Detect Enchantment</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion brightens the glow of any enchanted items within range of the potions effect. Three possible ingredients can be used to create this potion.<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\nHypha Facia<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nMixing hypha facia with marshmarrow is not recommended, as it will spoil the potion. Adding a dash of scuttle will lighten this potion, and add both the restore and fortify fatigue effects. You can also add saltrice or wickwheat to add restore health to your potion too.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Detect Key</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis fairly useful potion is similar to detect enchantment and has four possible ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nDiamond<BR>\r\nMuck<BR>\r\nSpore Pod<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no harmful combinations of ingredients for this potion. Muck and spore pods will create the lightest potions, and both ingredients are common.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Dispel</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion has no duration, only magnitude, much like cure potions. There are three possible ingredients you can use to create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBungler's Bane<BR>\r\nMoonsugar<BR>\r\nPearl<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nBungler's bane and moonsugar are a bad combination for this potion, as it will also drain your endurance.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Reflect</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is an excellent potion for reflecting spells. Made by a more experienced alchemist, it is often more effective than similar spells or enchantments. Three ingredients can be used:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\nDiamond<BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no bad combinations of ingredients for this potion. Hound meat will result in a heavier potion, but it is more cost effective than using diamonds.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Spell Absorbtion</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA favorite for mages, and often preferred over reflect. This potion can be created using three ingredients.<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nFire Petal<BR>\r\nVampire Dust<BR>\r\nVoid Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThese ingredients are more difficult to obtain than those for a reflect potion, but it is certainly worth it. Beware of mixing fire petals with void salts, which will produce an unwanted paralyze effect. If you find vampire dust difficult to obtain, you can instead mix in two more ingredients, such as willow anther and corkbulb root to create a cure paralyzation effect to counter paralyze within the same potion. Barring that, an alembic is your friend.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes the Alchemists Compendium. There are many more interesting combinations out there, and a whole lot of damaging ones. Experimentation is key. As always, happy mixing, my dear alchemists.<BR>"

It's divided into six parts based on the earlier editions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart One: Alchemy for Beginners and Basic Restore Potions<BR>\r\nPart Two: Potions of Curing<BR>\r\nPart Three: Potions of Restoration<BR>\r\nPart Four: Potions of Fortification<BR>\r\nPart Five: Potions of Resistance and Shielding<BR>\r\nPart Six: Potions of Magical Effect<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart One: Alchemy for Beginners<BR><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis first section of this book is intended for those with novice skill in alchemy, and explains the general processes involved.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Alchemist's Apparatus<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAn alchemist needs appropriate tools for the job. Below is a list of apparatus available. These can be found of varying quality; the better the quality, the better your potions will be. A mortar and pestle is required for all potion making. The other tools are optional, but you will get better results if you have one of each at your disposal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Mortar and Pestle</FONT><BR>\r\nThis is the most basic apparatus required to mix a potion. Your mortar and pestle's quality also determines the potion's strength. This simple apparatus is a must for any alchemist. To use, simply add your ingredients to the mortar, and stir or grind your ingredients with the pestle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Retort</FONT><BR>\r\nA retort is a basic distillation device used to increase the magnitude and duration of all positive effects in a potion. To use, place the ingredient, preferably in liquid form, in the bulb of the alembic, and heat with a small flame. In time, the distilled ingredient will collect and travel down the spout. This simple process requires little tending, just make sure you have plenty flasks at the ready.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Alembic</FONT><BR>\r\nThe alembic is used to decrease the magnitude and duration of all negative effects in a potion. This tool is necessary if you're forced to work with ingredients that combine negative effects, but unnecessary if there are none. Skooma pipes also make good alembics. The alembic is a distillation apparatus similar to the retort, but instead of one bulb, it has two or three bulbs connected by a tube.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Calcinator</FONT><BR>\r\nThe calcinator increases the magnitude and duration of all effects in a potion. Calcination is the process of heating a substance to just below its melting point. It is often used to drive off water or other volatile constituents, or to oxidize or reduce a substance. Careful experimentation will reveal how much heat and time is required for each ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGeneral Practice<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe easiest way for a beginner to practice alchemy is to sample ingredients. Of course, your skills will grow faster if you successfully mix a potion, but your failure rate will be high until you gain experience. It is best to have basic training before attempting your first potions, otherwise you'll be fumbling blind, and gain little experience in the art. Once you have the basic skills, you can increase your chance of success by fortifying intelligence and luck, allowing even the low skilled to become successful alchemists. You can find these recipes in the section on potions of fortification.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAny two ingredients with similar effect can be used to create a potion; however, some are better combinations than others. Potions effects do not multiply if you use more than two ingredients with the same effect. Multiple effects do occur however if your ingredients combine in more than one way. An alchemist must be wary of combining negative effects, which may spoil a potion if not filtered out with a quality alembic.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs you experiment, you may notice a difference in weight between one potion and another. Potion weight is determined by the mean weight of ingredients mixed. To obtain lighter potions, when only two heavy ingredients of the right combination are available, you can mix in lighter, neutral ingredients to reduce the potion's weight. Adding a cheaper, more available ingredient such as saltrice can lighten your potions, unless of course it happens to add a negative effect to the potion you're trying to make.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYou may find through your experiments that using the lightest ingredients possible will sometimes net you zero weight. This factor seems to be entirely up to chance. Believe me, I've tried fortifying my luck in the hopes of making this happen, and it doesn't always work. Still, it is quite the happy accident when it does happen.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBasic Potions<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Health</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMany readily available ingredients can be combined to make this essential potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow<BR>\r\nWickwheat<BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nResin<BR>\r\nEmerald<BR>\r\nCorprus Weepings<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nSaltrice, marshmarrow, wickwheat, and corkbulb root are lightweight and inexpensive, so they are the best choices. Resin, emeralds and corprus weepings produce the same effect, but are rarer and more expensive, so they are better saved for other potions. Beware of mixing marshmarrow and corprus weepings, since it will spoil the potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Fatigue</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is the easiest potion to make, as numerous ingredients produce this effect:</BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\nHackle-Lo Leaf<BR>\r\nChokeweed<BR>\r\nScrib Jerky<BR>\r\nScuttle<BR>\r\nBread<BR>\r\nSmall and Large Kwama Eggs<BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThe best, most lightweight ingredients are saltrice, hackle-lo leaf, chokeweed, scrib jerky, and scuttle. Heavier ingredients include bread, kwama eggs (small and large), crab meat, and hound meat. All these ingredients are readily available. Beware of bad combinations, as mixing large kwama eggs with hackle-lo leaf will create an unwanted paralyze effect and spoil your potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeavier ingredients may not be the best, but though you may not want to lug these around, they are great fodder for practice potions. Both bread and small kwama eggs have no other effect, so it is the best way to use them up and gain skill. You can also make easy coin selling them to vendors.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Magicka</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe ingredients for this potion are a more difficult to obtain, with the exception of comberry, but it is certainly worth the trouble. The ingredients that will produce this effect are:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\nDeadra's Heart<BR>\r\nFrost Salts<BR>\r\nVoid Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThis potion is perhaps best left until you have some experience, as most ingredients are expensive and difficult to obtain. Comberry, found throughout the Ascasdian Isles, is common and inexpensive. All other ingredients -- deadra's heart, frost salts, and void salts -- are more difficult to come by, and dangerous to hunt for. Nevertheless, this potion is one of the most useful you can make if you happen to use magic.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAny potion you make, even at a beginner's level, will be worth more than the ingredients themselves, so long as you choose them wisely. A shrewd alchemist has the potential to make quite a lot of money. There are many ingredients ripe and ready for the picking throughout Vvardenfell, and each potion you make will get you a little further, and a little richer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese basic potions will get you through your early experiments with alchemy. As you gain skill, you will learn more effects for the ingredients you have. With experimentation and experience, soon you'll be making potions to match the master alchemists themselves.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Two: Potions of Curing<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCure potions have no duration, only magnitude. They work instantly, are 100% effective, and are often more cost effective than similar spells. This first volume lists the five cure potions that can be created by the home alchemist.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Blight Disease</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is possibly the most important potion in Vvardenfell, as the blight has touched even the remotest corners of the land. A cure blight potion is a must for any adventurer, and costs far less than a spell of similar effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo cure blight, mix any two of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Salts<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAsh salts and scrib jelly are common ingredients, reasonably priced at most alchemists. Ash salts can also be obtained from ash ghouls, though it is not recommended you go hunting Red Mountain for them. Scrib jelly comes from scribs, a passive animal that is easy to kill. However, watch out for the blighted ones, or you may need this potion sooner than you think.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Common Disease</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother useful potion that can be made by mixing any two of the following ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nChokeweed<BR>\r\nGravedust<BR>\r\nGreen Lichen<BR>\r\nMuck<BR>\r\nRed Lichen<BR>\r\nWillow Anther<BR>\r\nDaedra Skin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt it not recommended to mix muck with either gravedust or willow anther, since it will spoil the potion. Gravedust does not go well with red lichen either.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAll ingredients listed are lightweight and fairly easy to obtain, with the exception of daedra skin, which is expensive and only available at fine alchemists.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Paralyzation</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is not only useful for adventuring, but can also counter potions that have an unwanted paralyze effect. Four common ingredients can be used to cure paralyzation:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\nScamp Skin<BR>\r\nWillow Anther<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt is not recommended to mix netch leather with willow anther, as it will produce a negative effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorkbulb root and willow anther grows in the Ascadian Isles region. You'll have to hunt netches or scamps to get their hides, which is not recommended for the novice adventurer. These ingredients are inexpensive and available in most alchemy shops.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Poison</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is essential if you happen to be hunting bull netches for their leather. Many ingredients produce this effect, so it can be made by mixing the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Lichen<BR>\r\nGhoul Heart<BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\nRat Meat<BR>\r\nRaw Ebony<BR>\r\nRoobrush<BR>\r\nScathecraw<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt is not recommended to mix scathecraw with either roobrush or black lichen. However, mixing scathecraw with scrib jelly or meteor slime will also produce a potion to restore willpower. Rat meat and ghoul heart have an added paralysis effect, so mixing them is not recommended unless you have a good quality alembic to filter out the effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt is important to keep track of the weight of your ingredients when making potions. For example, rat meat and raw ebony are heavy ingredients, so mixing these will produce a heavier potion that will encumber a traveler.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMost ingredients listed are fairly easy to obtain, with the exception of meteor slime, which is difficult to find. (Just a hint -- the bookseller Jobasha might know, but don't bother asking him about it.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Three: Potions of Restoration<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis part deals with potions of attribute restoration; potions of restore fatigue, health, and magicka are found in this author's previous work Alchemy for Beginners. Unfortunately, these homemade potions have a duration, which is unwanted in this case. When suffering a curse, it is better to buy potions of similar effect that have no duration to cure what ails you for good.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Agility</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnly two available ingredients can create this potion:<BR><BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBonemeal<BR>\r\nSload Soap<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nBoth these ingredients are fairly common. However, sload soap is relatively expensive because it is imported from the Black Marsh. It can be found at most fine alchemists. Bonemeal is found at grave sites on skeletons, undead or otherwise.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Endurance</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTwo simple ingredients can be combined to make this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nGravedust<BR>\r\nScales<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nGravedust can be found in most fine alchemists. Scales are found on slaughterfish, large or small. They are not difficult to find; just walk into the water, anywhere near Vvardenfell. Trust me, they will come.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Intelligence</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made by combining any two of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBittergreen Petals (treated or otherwise)<BR>\r\nRuby<BR>\r\nScrap Metal<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThis potion is somewhat frustrating to make as the ingredients, aside from bittergreen petals, are difficult to obtain. Scrap metal can be found plundering Dwemer ruins, but it is incredibly heavy, so lugging it out of these dangerous fortresses is almost as difficult as dissasembling Dwemer centurions. Due to its weight, it makes heavy potions, which is not ideal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCombining rubies and scrap metal will also create a negative effect, so it is not recommended. The best combination is rubies and bittergreen petals. Though rubies are expensive, they are lightweight and easier to obtain than scrap metal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Luck</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThree readily available ingredients can be used to produce this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nHack-Lo Leaf<BR>\r\nKresh Fiber<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining crab meat and hack-lo leaf will also restore fatigue, though the potion will be heavier than combining hackle-lo leaf and kresh fiber.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Personality</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo create this potion, any two of the following ingredients are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\nHeather<BR>\r\nScamp Skin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from any of these combined, but guar hide will leave you with a heavier potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Strength</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough this potion uses fairly common ingredients, you must beware when mixing them:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDreugh Wax<BR>\r\nGold Kanet<BR>\r\nRoland's Tear<BR>\r\nScamp Skin<BR>\r\nStoneflower Petals<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nMixing either gold kanet, roland's tear (a type of gold kanet), dreugh wax, or stoneflower petals will result in a drain luck effect. These ingredients should be combined with scamp skin instead, whenever possible.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Speed</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can only be made with the following two ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nResin<BR>\r\nRaw Ebony<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt is unfortunate that raw ebony is both expensive and heavy. Resin can be bought from a few select alchemists and vendors, so it is not common either.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Willpower</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made by combining:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\nScathecraw<BR>\r\nTrama Root<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining scathecraw with scrib jelly or meteor slime will also cure poison. Combining meteor slime with scrib jelly will cure poison and fortify willpower as well. However, meteor slime is a rare ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Four: Potions of Fortifcation<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis part is divided into two sections: the first for attribute fortification potions, and the second for other fortification effects.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: Attribute Fortification<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Agility</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGreat for marksmen, or just about anyone, the following can be combined to produce this effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nEctoplasm<BR>\r\nFire Salts<BR>\r\nRoobrush<BR>\r\nSload Soap<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThese ingredients are fairly common, though you'll have to hunt flame atronachs for fire salts, and undead spirits for ectoplasm, if you don't wish to buy them. Combining the former two ingredients or roobrush is not recommended, because it will poison the potion. These three ingredients must be combined with sload soap instead. Combining sload soap with fire falts will also create a potion of fire shield.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Endurance</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion works well in combination with fortify speed. Three possible ingredients can be combined to make this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDaedra's Heart<BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAll three ingredients will produce a heavy potion, so mixing them with some lighter, neutral ingredients is recommended if you intend to use potion for traveling.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Intelligence</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis useful potion is a must for alchemists and enchanters alike. It can be made by combining any two of the following readily available ingredients:\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAsh yams are abundant in Vvardenfell, so it is perhaps best combined with the other ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Luck</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis, like the previous recipe, will help enhance your alchemy or enchanting abilities. It can be made using the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nCorprus Weepings<BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCorkbulb root and guar hide are common ingredients, therefore the easiest combination for this recipe. Combining guar hide with corprus weepings will spoil the potion. However, combining corprus weepings with corkbulb root will also create a potion of restore health.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Personality</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA must when bargaining for more expensive alchemy ingredients. To create this potion, any two of the following are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nGreen Lichen<BR>\r\nKresh Fiber<BR>\r\nStoneflower Petals<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients, and all are easy to obtain.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Strength</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be created with the following ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nDaedra Skin<BR>\r\nDreugh Wax<BR>\r\nVampire Dust<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients. Ash yams and dreugh wax are the more abundant of the four, therefore the most likely choice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Speed</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGreat for traveling on foot, or getting out of a fight, this potion can be made with the following three ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nKagouti Hide<BR>\r\nMoon Sugar<BR>\r\nShalk Resin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nBe aware that combining kagouti hide with shalk resin will spoil the potion. Unfortunately, moon sugar trade is illegal in Morrowind, so it may be difficult to obtain.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Willpower</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made using any two of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\nWickwheat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining meteor slime with scrib jelly will cure poison and fortify willpower as well.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: Other Fortification Recipes\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Fatigue</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis not only fortifies, but restores as well. This wonderful dual purpose potion can be made by combining:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\nScrib Jerky<BR>\r\nScuttle<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nScrib jerky and scuttle produce a much lighter potion than combining either with hound meat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Health</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is incredibly handy, but unfortunately doesn't have the best combinations of ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHuman Flesh<BR>\r\nLarge Kwama Egg<BR>\r\nShalk Resin<BR>\r\nVampire Dust<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nNever combine shalk resin with human flesh. Scuttle and vampire dust is the optimal combination, but is expensive. The easiest combination is shalk resin with a large kwama egg. This creates a heavy potion, but the weight can be leveled out by adding lighter, neutral ingredients. Depending on which neutral ingredients you choose, this can also produce extra effects.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCombining a large kwama egg with a light restore health ingredient such as saltrice, marshmarrow, or wickwheat will create a potion that restores health at the same time. The more light ingredients you add to the potion, the lighter your potion will be, so what the heck, add two.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Magicka</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made by combining two of these three ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nEmerald<BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\nStoneflower Petals<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining emeralds with saltrice will have the added benefit of restoring heath.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Five: Potions of Resistance and Shielding<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: Recipes of Resistance Potions<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Common Disease</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following can be combined to produce this effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nKagouti Hide<BR>\r\nPearl<BR>\r\nResin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these four ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Poison</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother great potion for bull netch hunting. Three possible ingredients can be combined to make this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAlit Hide<BR>\r\nKwama Cuttle<BR>\r\nRat Meat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAny of these three ingredients will produce a heavy potion, so mixing them with lighter, neutral ingredients is recommended if you intend to use this potion for traveling. Combining rat meat with kwama cuttle, and a lighter cure poison ingredient such as scrib jelly will not only lighten your potion, but create a potion that cures poison as well. The key is to use rat meat, which produces both effects. Kwama cuttle was chosen because it is lighter than alit hide.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Fire</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made using the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Anther<BR>\r\nFire Petal<BR>\r\nFrost Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Frost</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnly two ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Lichen<BR>\r\nFire Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Shock</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is another wonderful dual purpose potion, creating a lightning shield as well. To mix this potion, the two following ingredients are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nScrap Metal<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThis potion is incredibly heavy, so you may want to add lighter, neutral ingredients to it. Adding an ingredient such as saltrice will also add the benefit of restore fatigue. Combine that with marshmarrow or wickwheat, and you have an even lighter potion that restores health as well, for little added cost. Get creative!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: Recipes of Shield Potions<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fire Shield</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following will produce the desired effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\nFire Salts<BR>\r\nRaw Glass<BR>\r\nSload Soap<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining fire salts and sload soap will also create a potion of fortify agility. Raw glass is heavy, and fire shield is the only positive effect you can create with it. It is also expensive, so it is better bartered for more useful ingredients than used in home alchemy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Frost Shield</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following will produce the desired effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nFrost Salts<BR>\r\nLarge Kwama Egg<BR>\r\nRaw Ebony<BR>\r\nWillow Anther<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects by combining any of these ingredients. However, both kwama eggs and raw ebony are heavy, therefore not the best combination.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Lightning Shield</FONT><BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nThe following ingredients produce the desired effect:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nScrap Metal<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAside from crab meat and scrap metal, which is also used in the shock resistance potion mentioned in the first section, corkbulb root can also be used to create a plain lightning shield potion without the added effect. It produces a lighter potion if scrap metal is not used.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Six: Potions of Magical Effect<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis part comprises of three sections: the first deals with potions of alteration, the second on potions of illusion, and the third on potions of mysticism. This compendium only deals with potions of positive effect, but harmful potions can also be made within the same schools of magic, such as burden or paralyze.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: Potions of Alteration<BR><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Feather</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFeather will make your burdens lighter, and your ruin raiding much brighter. The following three ingredients can be combined to produce this effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHeather<BR>\r\nRuby<BR>\r\nScuttle<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Levitate</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is a must for any Telvanni sorcerer, and can be made with any of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCoda Flower<BR>\r\nRacer Plumes<BR>\r\nTrama Root<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAny combination of these ingredients will result in excellent potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Swift Swim</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA most excellent potion for pearl diving, it can be made using the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDaedra Skin<BR>\r\nScales<BR>\r\nScrib Jerky<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nScales and scrib jerky are the most common combination because they are more readily available ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Water Breathing</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother must for you pearl divers out there. Four possible ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHackle-Lo Leaf<BR>\r\nKwama Cuttle<BR>\r\nLuminous Russula<BR>\r\nPearl<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nLuminous russula and kwama cuttle are not a good combination and will spoil your potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Water Walking</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion will save your life when the slaughterfish become too much for you. To create this potion, two of the four following ingredients are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAmpoule Pod<BR>\r\nKwama Cuttle<BR>\r\nScales<BR>\r\nViolet Coprinus<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nKwama cuttle will create a spoiled potion with violet coprinus, as it does with luminous russula.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: Potions of Illusion<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Invisibility</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is not the best potion for thievery, as some have suggested, but for casual sneaking it will do. Only two possible ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBittergreen Petals (also treated Bittergreen Petals)<BR>\r\nDiamond<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Light</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion's effect is different from the spell; because it only works on the imbiber, it is similar to night eye. Only two ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Anther<BR>\r\nRed Lichen<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Night Eye</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor seeing in the dark, of course. The two ingredients that can create this potion are:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDaedra's Heart<BR>\r\nKagouti Hide<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nSeeing as daedra's heart is difficult to obtain, a potion of light may be a better choice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Three: Potions of Mysticism\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Detect Animal</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf you don't have a potion of night eye (or light) on you, this potion will help you avoid stepping on rats as you explore dark caves. You may use a combination of four possible ingredients to create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAlit Hide<BR>\r\nAmpoule Pod<BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nEctoplasm<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from any combination of these ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Detect Enchantment</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion brightens the glow of any enchanted items within range of the potions effect. Three possible ingredients can be used to create this potion.<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\nHypha Facia<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nMixing hypha facia with marshmarrow is not recommended, as it will spoil the potion. Adding a dash of scuttle will lighten this potion, and add both the restore and fortify fatigue effects. You can also add saltrice or wickwheat to add restore health to your potion too.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Detect Key</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis fairly useful potion is similar to detect enchantment and has four possible ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nDiamond<BR>\r\nMuck<BR>\r\nSpore Pod<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no harmful combinations of ingredients for this potion. Muck and spore pods will create the lightest potions, and both ingredients are common.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Dispel</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion has no duration, only magnitude, much like cure potions. There are three possible ingredients you can use to create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBungler's Bane<BR>\r\nMoonsugar<BR>\r\nPearl<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nBungler's bane and moonsugar are a bad combination for this potion, as it will also drain your endurance.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Reflect</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is an excellent potion for reflecting spells. Made by a more experienced alchemist, it is often more effective than similar spells or enchantments. Three ingredients can be used:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\nDiamond<BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no bad combinations of ingredients for this potion. Hound meat will result in a heavier potion, but it is more cost effective than using diamonds.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Spell Absorbtion</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA favorite for mages, and often preferred over reflect. This potion can be created using three ingredients.<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nFire Petal<BR>\r\nVampire Dust<BR>\r\nVoid Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThese ingredients are more difficult to obtain than those for a reflect potion, but it is certainly worth it. Beware of mixing fire petals with void salts, which will produce an unwanted paralyze effect. If you find vampire dust difficult to obtain, you can instead mix in two more ingredients, such as willow anther and corkbulb root to create a cure paralyzation effect to counter paralyze within the same potion. Barring that, an alembic is your friend.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes the Alchemists Compendium. There are of course, more interesting combinations out there, and a whole lot of damaging ones. Experimentation is key, and, as always, happy mixing dear alchemists!<BR>"

This book focuses on Vvardenfell's different regions, and the plants most commonly found within them. Each region is divided into the following sections:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: The Bitter Coast<BR>\r\nSection Two: The Ascadian Isles<BR>\r\nSection Three: West Gash<BR>\r\nSection Four: The Ashlands and Molag Amur<BR>\r\nSection Five: Grazelands<BR>\r\nSection Six: Azura's Coast and Sheogorad<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: The Bitter Coast<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Bitter Coast runs along the southeastern edge of Vvardenfell. Most flora in this region is of the fungal variety, which glows with mysterious beauty in the dark marshes. The region's native plants thrive in heavy rainfall, which has kept this ecosystem in balance, and relatively safe against the Blight, for thousands of years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBungler's Bane<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis fungal shelf is found growing on trees alongside its cousin hypa facia. It is distinguished by mottled coloration, compared to its lighter, smoother cousin. This fungus is poisonous, but can be used in dispel potions when mixed appropriately.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nDispel<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDraggle Tail<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDraggle tail is a marsh weed found growing deep in the green marshes of the Bitter Coast. Often one will find an ampoule pod, the draggle tail's immature fruiting body, on the end of a thick stalk. The large bulbous pod has a soft blue glow. Though the ampoule pod develops from the coda flower, the draggle tail's alchemical properties change from flower to fruit. The pod is easier for the novice herbalist to gather than the delicate coda flower.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe coda flower has a bright blue glow, prized by alchemists and florists alike. Poor fishermen along the Bitter Coast often place the flowers in their homes when candles are in short supply, but it has gradually found its way into upper class homes due to its beauty, and its association with the Shrine to Stop the Moon. The coda flower is symbolic of enlightenment. It has only one use in alchemy, but as levitation potions are in high demand, that one use makes it a prized ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Ampoule Pod:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWater walking<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nDetect Animal<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Coda Flower:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nLevitate<BR>\r\nDrain Intelligence<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHypha Fascia<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLike bungler's bane, this fungal shelf is found growing on trees and wet marshy rocks. Its lighter, smoother coloration distinguishes it from its cousin. It is also poisonous when ingested. Its only alchemical use is in detect enchantment potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nDetect Enchantment<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLuminous Russula<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis dark mottled mushroom is large and odorous, and has a faint luminosity, as its name suggests. These mushrooms are often found tucked into rocks along the coast, and in dark caverns across Vvardenfell. When placed in the mouth, it allows one to breath water for a short period. It is used extensively by local pearl divers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWater Breathing<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nPoison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSpore Pod<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis thick bulbous pod is found growing on the slough fern. It is tough and inedible, but has a singular use in detect key potions. As an alchemical commodity, it is not in high demand, and often not worth gathering. It also takes a good amount of crushing to remove the jelly from its thick skin.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nViolet Coprinus<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis large mushroom has a bright blue skin and is softly luminescent. It is often used in floral displays alongside the coda flower. It is found in dark places alongside luminous russula, and in thick marshes where draggle tail grows. When ingested, it allows the traveler to walk lightly on water.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWater Walking<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nPoison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: The Ascadian Isles<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNorth of the Bitter Coast is the beautiful Ascadian Isles. This area is a favorite of Imperial tourists, as it most closely reminds them of home. This region's rich soil provides for an abundance of beautiful flowers and staple crops. Local farmers harvest staple foods such as saltrice and marshmarrow, and grow flowering plants for herbal remedies. If you happen to be in the area, make sure to visit the Fields of Kummu. This local shrine is teeming with local wildlife, lovingly preserved in its natural state by the Tribunal Temple for hundreds of years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh yams are not found in the wild, but grown extensively on farms throughout the area. This sweet tuber is a staple food throughout Vvardenfell. The large purplish tuber is recognizable by spiky leaves sticking out of its top. The tuber grows so large, it bursts from the ground until its bulb pokes halfway out of the soil. When eaten, it temporarily heightens awareness, but it has many other alchemical uses when distilled into potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Intelligence<BR>\r\nFortify Strength<BR>\r\nResist Common Disease<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBlack Anther<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis local flower has large open petals with dark violet tips, and a long stamen. The dark heavy leaves of this tall flower often point towards the ground. The beauty of this flower is undeniable. However, it is not often used in floral displays because it symbolizes sexual desire and betrayal. It is the flower of the vamp, an image popularized by the song \"Black Anther (the Vampiress)\" by the bard Jademis Crowl. The stamens are collected by alchemists, though their use is limited.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nResist Fire<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nLight<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe comberry bush has bright red berries, used in many local recipes and brews. Uncooked comberry causes fatigue, which is useful for sleeping draughts. The comberry has a slight bitter aftertaste and is incredibly tart, but other than the ash yam, has the sweetest flavor found in Vvardenfell. It is found in the wild and on local farms. Distilled comberry has many alchemical uses.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nRestore Magica<BR>\r\nFire Shield<BR>\r\nReflect<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis tuber is another staple food, found in the wild and on local farms. It is larger than the ash yam, and has a tougher hide. Its leaves are large, wide, and forms a parasol over the the large bulb. Corkbulb grows deep in the soil, and is somewhat difficult to dig up; farmers often employ tamed guars for the purpose. Corkbulb root is the guar's favorite meal, and this animal can smell it from a mile away. Be aware that wild guars will attack if you are carrying corkbulb root on your person. Besides being a tasty and nutritous food, this root is also a useful alchemical ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCure Paralyzation<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nLightning Shield<BR>\r\nFortify Luck<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGold Kanet<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGold kanet's small golden flowers grow in clusters atop a large thick stem. Its large wide fan-like leaves are dark green, its lush foliage bush-like. Gold kanet traditionally symbolizes long lasting friendship, and dried cuttings from this flower are often given as a symbolic gesture. It is also a symbol of loyalty, worn by candidates during oath of service ceremonies of the Indoril and Ordinators. The famed gold kanet flower Roland's Tear is found in a small remote part of the Ascadian Isles; its exact location is unknown. Despite its symbolic importance in Vvardenfell, the alchemical uses of this flower are limited, only good for potions to restore strength. Since its primary alchemical properties are detrimental to health and well being, it must be carefully prepared for use in potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nBurden<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nRestore Strength<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeather<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeather is a small cluster of pink flowers that grow close to the ground. Its leaves are small and spiny, which make it quite painful to pick. Heather is symbolic of young idyllic love and shy admiration; the young often leave it anonymously on the doorsteps of their sweethearts. When a young man or woman is caught daydreaming, they are often told they are \"out picking heather.\" Heather is picked fresh and eaten during times of heartbreak, as it is said to restore one's confidence and lighten one's burdens. In alchemy, heather is most often used in potions of feather.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Personality<BR>\r\nFeather<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWillow Flower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWillow flowers are large, with clusters of soft white anthers cupped in broad pinkish-red leaves. The leaves are folded in the middle, forming what is described as an \"upside-down cup\" or \"capsized boat.\" In Vvardenfell, the willow flower is worn by a bride on her wedding day, as it symbolizes purity and devotion. The flower's anthers have many alchemical uses.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nFrost Shield<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nCure Paralyzation<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Three: The West Gash<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe West Gash region is located near the western coast of Vvardenfell. It runs all the way from the north to the mountains of the Ascadian Isles. Is is sandwiched between two mountain ranges: the Bitter Coast to the southwest, and the rocky Ashlands to the west. Its climate is semi-arid, but still affords a beautiful landscape teeming with life.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChokeweed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChokeweed is the most common plant found in this area, named thus because its overgrowth tends to block off roads and mountainous passages. It is a tall, straight bush-like plant, with fans of sharp pointy leaves that look like lace. The leaves are tough and difficult to cut from the branches. Despite its reputation as \"the unlucky leaf,\" it has its uses in alchemy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRoobrush<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough roobrush appears similar to chokeweed, its fans of foliage are broader and covered in numerous small, flat leaves. It does not grow as tall or straight as chokeweed, and is distinguished by its tough greenish-orange fruit. This fruit is not edible, but it has alchemical uses. It is often used as a poison that, when administered to strong drink, is meant to drain the willpower of your enemies and kill them slowly. Roobrush poison has been used extensively in the centuries long feuds between the great houses of Morrowind.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\nFortify Agility<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStoneflower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe stoneflower is also found in the wilds of the Ascadian Isles, but it is a true native of the West Gash. The rich blue flowers are prolific there, for they have little competition. Conical in shape, with pointed petals, the large heavy flowers bend towards the ground. The leaves are similar to the willow flower; the two species may be related. Stoneflower traditionally represents death and mourning, so it is often use in Dunmer funeral cerimonies. The petals have varied uses in alchemy, and they are also edible. They have a vaguely sweet taste, and a soft velvety texture.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Strength<BR>\r\nFortify Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nFortify Personality<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Four: The Ashlands and Molag Amur<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBoth the Ashlands and Molag Amur are barren rocky wastelands. A few hardy specimens of plant life grow in these regions. These vast, mountainous lands make up a large part of Morrowind. The Ashlands are located in northern Vvardenfell, between the West Gash to the west and the Grazelands to the east, with Red Mountain occupying the southeast corner. Molag Amur is located in the southeast, west of Azura's Coast, and south of the Grazelands. These regions are plagued by ash storms, and many creatures roaming the area are blighted. It is a harsh and dangerous landscape, populated by the hardy and steadfast Ashlander tribes of the Dunmer people.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBittergreen Plant<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough this hardy specimen has made its way into the West Gash region, it is ideally suited to the rocky climes of the Ashlands. This plant has a large thick-husked pod, with several long reaching branches curling from it. On these branches grow small clusters of pointed green leaves that look almost flower-like. Bittergreen \"petals\" are edible, and used to restore intelligence. Redoran nobility use it as a garnish in their dishes. Bittergreen petals have the rare distinction of being the only local substance you can combine with diamonds to produce invisibility potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Intelligence<BR>\r\nInvisibility<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFire Fern<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFire fern is unlike most native flowers in Vvardenfell, as it blooms perennially. This plant requires heat to survive, so it tends to grow in volcanic areas, and near hot-springs and geysers. This flower's deep red petals protects traveler's from heat and fire when placed under the tongue. The fire fern has religious significance for the Tribunal Temple; representing the trials of Lord Vivec, it is symbolic of triumph against near impossible odds.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResist Fire<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nSpell Absorbtion<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLichen<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLichen are found in dry mountainous regions, usually growing on rocks. They are both plants and fungus, a colony of each in symbiosis with one another. They are not uncommon, but are difficult to spot. There are three varieties of lichen: black, green, and red. Each have different alchemical properties, so some are more valued than others. Red lichen has a higher value when bought and sold by alchemists. Green lichen is the only type that is edible.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Black Lichen:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nResist Frost<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Green Lichen:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Personality<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Red Lichen<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nLight<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScathecraw Plant<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScathecraw is a type of fern with deep purplish-red leaves. Ashlanders use these tall broad leaves to wrap and preserve food. Scathecraw plants are also found adorning homes in Redoran settlements. Scathecraw is abundant in the rocky regions of Vvardenfell, bringing life to an otherwise barren landscape. The people of Ald'Ruhn often say, \"Scathecraw's simple beauty is here to remind us that life is worth living, even in the harshest and darkest of times.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nRestore Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTrama Root<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTrama root is the primary staple food of the Ashlanders. This long, twisting root is covered in rows of purplish spikes. Though tough on its exterior, breaking off one of these spines reveals a soft, edible center. It is not the best tasting, being slightly bitter, but it is sustaining. Without the simple trama root, the Ashlanders could not live off the land in the unforgiving Ashlands. This abundant tuber is also a key component in levitation potions, making it high in demand in Telvanni cities.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Willpower<BR>\r\nLevitate<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Five: The Grazelands<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grazelands are grassy plains on the northeastern edge of Vvardenfell. Due east of the barren Ashlands, the Grazelands are protected from ash storms by a vast mountain range. Stoneflowers, previously covered in the West Gash chapter, also grow in this temperate, semi-arid region. Though there is not much floral variety in this area, there is certainly abundance. The soil is fertile, perfect for farmland, but the land remains wild and untamed. This pastoral landscape is fraught with danger, as it it also home to roaming Daedra. Locals fear to stray too far from the roads, sticking closely to established settlements. There are also several Ashlander camps in this region.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHackle-Lo<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHackle-lo is a large palm, consisting of a trunk of soft prickly fibers topped by a frond of long green leaves. Coastal hackle-lo are often shorter and look like ferns, due to environmental differences in light levels, predators, and competition. Though hackle-lo is found across Vvardenfell's coastal regions, it thrives in the southern Grazelands near Falensarano. Here, the hackle-lo stand tall as they did, across the continent, in ages past. Hackle-lo is in danger of extinction as the Ashlands creep ever closer to the coasts. Despite hackle-lo's rough exterior, this plant is delicate, and ash storms are deadly to it. Despite the plant's dwindling numbers, hackle-lo leaf remains a common local food source.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nWater Breathing<BR>\r\nRestore Luck<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWickwheat<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grazelands thrives with wickwheat, growing like weeds in the area. It is the most abundant plant in Vvardenfell, yet it is hardly used as a common food source. More Dunmer use wickwheat to patch their roofs than eat it; one wonders why. It has restorative properties when eaten, and makes fine bread. However, most locals prefer bread made with saltrice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nFortify Willpower<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nDamage Intelligence<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Six: Azura's Coast and Sheogorad<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAzura's Coast is the preferred location for Telvanni settlements, as the environment is more conducive to growing their tall mushroom towers. The region stretches from the southeasternmost tip of the continent, across the western coast, and into Zafirbel Bay. Azura's Coast is named after the Shrine of Azura. Both it and Sheogorad are lands of wild magic and roaming Daedra. Sheogorad, commonly known for its largest settlement Dagon Fel, is the chain of Vvardenfell's northernmost islands. Both these regions have similar coastal flora, tall mushroom trees and tangled reeds, though they are found in more abundance to the south.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKreshweed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKreshweed grows along Azura's Coast, and to a lesser extent the West Gash and Sheogorad. Its preferred habitat is near saline coastal waters. It can be difficult to discern from other course grasses in the area. Its leaves are long, broad, flat, and fan upwards from the base of the stem. When in bloom, it can be identified by pale yellow trumpet-shaped flowers. Kreshweed fiber has modest alchemical properties. Known locally as \"luck weed,\" it has restorative properties to match. Vos peasants sew kresh fibers into their clothing, but it has no beneficial effect unless consumed or distilled into a potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Luck<BR>\r\nFortify Personality<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow is a tall reed that grows across the coastal regions, and is also farmed in the Ascadian Isles. It is a common food source throughout Vvardenfall. Its marrow is quite sweet. It is the preferred flavoring for most local dishes, or can be eaten raw. It is often given to pacify children. Marshmarrow prefers wet climates and grows best in shallow water. It has restorative properties similar to wickwheat, which can be used in combination to create potions to restore health.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nDetect Enchantment<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMucksponge<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMucksponge once grew in abundance across Vvardenfall. The legend of Vivec in the Fields of Kummu tells how he helped a poor farmer shovel muck, but mucksponge cannot be found in the region today. Mucksponge needs wet climes to survive. Though it is primarily found growing wild along Azura's Coast, it is also cultivated on the north-easternmost coast of the West Gash near Gnisis. Mucksponge is a tall whitish pod with mottled brown spots. Its large cavity in the top is filled with muck, which is harvested using shovels. Mucksponge can produce on average up to 5 tons of muck per year. When it is not harvested, the cavity fills until it runs over onto the soil, which fertilizes nearby plant growth. Muck is used to fortify soil for other crops. As the farmer's friend, the lowly mucksponge has a revered place in Morrowind's history. Muck, not the flesh of the sponge itself, has alchemical properties.\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Intelligence<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSaltrice is the primary staple food across Vvardenfall. It grows wild along the shores of Azura's Coast, and in abundance in Zafirbel Bay. It is also cultivated on farms in the Ascadian Isles. Saltrice has a long history, considered a holy staple by the Tribunal Temple. It is the only food allowed to Temple initiates during certain months of the year, because it is associated with austerity, and purity of body and soul. Saltrice's name derives from its salty flavor, due to drawing in salt from the seawater it typically thrives in. The Saltrice plant has long, broad green leaves. The head of rice is coated in a light pink husk. It has natural restorative properties. It can be eaten raw, but is more often cooked in numerous local dishes. Bread made from saltrice gains its primary restorative property. In alchemy it is has many positive properties, and is otherwise fairly neutral. It is often added to potions to level out their weight, since it is light, inexpensive, and abundant.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nFortify Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nRestore Heath<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFlowers native to the Ascadian Isles, such as willow flower and gold kanet, also grow in these regions, but not in great abundance. Thus concludes the Vvardenfell Flora Compendium. For my next book, I will travel to Mournhold on the Morrowind mainland to seek out its natural plant life. Until then, dear reader.<BR>"

This series focuses on Vvardenfell's different regions, and the plants most commonly found within them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Bitter Coast runs along the southwestern edge of Vvardenfell. Most flora in this region is of the fungal variety, which glows with mysterious beauty in the dark marshes. The region's native plants thrive in heavy rainfall, which has kept this ecosystem in balance, and relatively safe against the Blight, for thousands of years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBungler's Bane<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis fungal shelf is found growing on trees alongside its cousin hypha facia. It is distinguished by mottled coloration, compared to its lighter, smoother cousin. This fungus is poisonous, but can be used in dispel potions when mixed appropriately.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nDispel<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDraggle Tail<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDraggle tail is a marsh weed found growing deep in the green marshes of the Bitter Coast. Often one will find an ampoule pod, the draggle tail's immature fruiting body, on the end of a thick stalk. The large bulbous pod has a soft blue glow. Though the ampoule pod develops from the coda flower, the draggle tail's alchemical properties change from flower to fruit. The pod is easier for the novice herbalist to gather than the delicate coda flower.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe coda flower has a bright blue glow, prized by alchemists and florists alike. Poor fishermen along the Bitter Coast often place the flowers in their homes when candles are in short supply, but it has gradually found its way into upper class homes due to its beauty, and its association with the Shrine to Stop the Moon. The coda flower is symbolic of enlightenment. It has only one use in alchemy, but as levitation potions are in high demand, that one use makes it a prized ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Ampoule Pod:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWater walking<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nDetect Animal<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Coda Flower:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nLevitate<BR>\r\nDrain Intelligence<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHypha Facia<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLike bungler's bane, this fungal shelf is found growing on trees and wet marshy rocks. Its lighter, smoother coloration distinguishes it from its cousin. It is also poisonous when ingested. Its only alchemical use is in detect enchantment potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nDetect Enchantment<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLuminous Russula<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis dark mottled mushroom is large and odorous, and has a faint luminosity, as its name suggests. These mushrooms are often found tucked into rocks along the coast, and in dark caverns across Vvardenfell. When placed in the mouth, it allows one to breath water for a short period. It is used extensively by local pearl divers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWater Breathing<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nPoison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSpore Pod<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis thick bulbous pod is found growing on the slough fern. It is tough and inedible, but has a singular use in detect key potions. As an alchemical commodity, it is not in high demand, and often not worth gathering. It also takes a good amount of crushing to remove the jelly from its thick skin.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nViolet Coprinus<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis large mushroom has a bright blue skin and is softly luminescent. It is often used in floral displays alongside the coda flower. It is found in dark places alongside luminous russula, and in thick marshes where draggle tail grows. When ingested, it allows the traveler to walk lightly on water.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWater Walking<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nPoison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn the next volume, we will discuss the flora of the Ascadian Isles.

This series focuses on Vvardenfell's different regions, and the plants most commonly found within them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNorth of the Bitter Coast is the beautiful Ascadian Isles. This area is a favorite of Imperial tourists, as it most closely reminds them of home. This region's rich soil provides for an abundance of beautiful flowers and staple crops. Local farmers harvest staple foods such as saltrice and marshmarrow, and grow flowering plants for herbal remedies. If you happen to be in the area, make sure to visit the Fields of Kummu. This local shrine is teeming with local wildlife, lovingly preserved in its natural state by the Tribunal Temple for hundreds of years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh yams are not found in the wild, but grown extensively on farms throughout the area. This sweet tuber is a staple food throughout Vvardenfell. The large purplish tuber is recognizable by spiky leaves sticking out of its top. The tuber grows so large, it bursts from the ground until its bulb pokes halfway out of the soil. When eaten, it temporarily heightens awareness, but it has many other alchemical uses when distilled into potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Intelligence<BR>\r\nFortify Strength<BR>\r\nResist Common Disease<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBlack Anther<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis local flower has large open petals with dark violet tips, and a long stamen. The dark heavy leaves of this tall flower often point towards the ground. The beauty of this flower is undeniable. However, it is not often used in floral displays because it symbolizes sexual desire and betrayal. It is the flower of the vamp, an image popularized by the song \"Black Anther (the Vampiress)\" by the bard Jademis Crowl. The stamens are collected by alchemists, though their use is limited.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nResist Fire<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nLight<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe comberry bush has bright red berries, used in many local recipes and brews. Uncooked comberry causes fatigue, which is useful for sleeping draughts. The comberry has a slight bitter aftertaste and is incredibly tart, but other than the ash yam, has the sweetest flavor found in Vvardenfell. It is found in the wild and on local farms. Distilled comberry has many alchemical uses.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nRestore Magica<BR>\r\nFire Shield<BR>\r\nReflect<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis tuber is another staple food, found in the wild and on local farms. It is larger than the ash yam, and has a tougher hide. Its leaves are large, wide, and forms a parasol over the the large bulb. Corkbulb grows deep in the soil, and is somewhat difficult to dig up; farmers often employ tamed guars for the purpose. Corkbulb root is the guar's favorite meal, and this animal can smell it from a mile away. Be aware that wild guars will attack if you are carrying corkbulb root on your person. Besides being a tasty and nutritous food, this root is also a useful alchemical ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCure Paralyzation<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nLightning Shield<BR>\r\nFortify Luck<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGold Kanet<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGold kanet's small golden flowers grow in clusters atop a large thick stem. Its large wide fan-like leaves are dark green, its lush foliage bush-like. Gold kanet traditionally symbolizes long lasting friendship, and dried cuttings from this flower are often given as a symbolic gesture. It is also a symbol of loyalty, worn by candidates during oath of service ceremonies of the Indoril and Ordinators. The famed gold kanet flower Roland's Tear is found in a small remote part of the Ascadian Isles; its exact location is unknown. Despite its symbolic importance in Vvardenfell, the alchemical uses of this flower are limited, only good for potions to restore strength. Since its primary alchemical properties are detrimental to health and well being, it must be carefully prepared for use in potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nBurden<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nRestore Strength<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeather<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeather is a small cluster of pink flowers that grow close to the ground. Its leaves are small and spiny, which make it quite painful to pick. Heather is symbolic of young idyllic love and shy admiration; the young often leave it anonymously on the doorsteps of their sweethearts. When a young man or woman is caught daydreaming, they are often told they are \"out picking heather.\" Heather is picked fresh and eaten during times of heartbreak, as it is said to restore one's confidence and lighten one's burdens. In alchemy, heather is most often used in potions of feather.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Personality<BR>\r\nFeather<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWillow Flower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWillow flowers are large, with clusters of soft white anthers cupped in broad pinkish-red leaves. The leaves are folded in the middle, forming what is described as an \"upside-down cup\" or \"capsized boat.\" In Vvardenfell, the willow flower is worn by a bride on her wedding day, as it symbolizes purity and devotion. The flower's anthers have many alchemical uses.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nFrost Shield<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nCure Paralyzation<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes the volume on the Ascadian Isles.

This series focuses on Vvardenfell's different regions, and the plants most commonly found within them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe West Gash region is located near the western coast of Vvardenfell. It runs all the way from the north to the mountains of the Ascadian Isles. Is is sandwiched between two mountain ranges: the Bitter Coast to the southwest, and the rocky Ashlands to the west. Its climate is semi-arid, but still affords a beautiful landscape teeming with life.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChokeweed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChokeweed is the most common plant found in this area, named thus because its overgrowth tends to block off roads and mountainous passages. It is a tall, straight bush-like plant, with fans of sharp pointy leaves that look like lace. The leaves are tough and difficult to cut from the branches. Despite its reputation as \"the unlucky leaf,\" it has its uses in alchemy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRoobrush<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough roobrush appears similar to chokeweed, its fans of foliage are broader and covered in numerous small, flat leaves. It does not grow as tall or straight as chokeweed, and is distinguished by its tough greenish-orange fruit. This fruit is not edible, but it has alchemical uses. It is often used as a poison that, when administered to strong drink, is meant to drain the willpower of your enemies and kill them slowly. Roobrush poison has been used extensively in the centuries long feuds between the great houses of Morrowind.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\nFortify Agility<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStoneflower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe stoneflower is also found in the wilds of the Ascadian Isles, but it is a true native of the West Gash. The rich blue flowers are prolific there, for they have little competition. Conical in shape, with pointed petals, the large heavy flowers bend towards the ground. The leaves are similar to the willow flower; the two species may be related. Stoneflower traditionally represents death and mourning, so it is often use in Dunmer funeral cerimonies. The petals have varied uses in alchemy, and they are also edible. They have a vaguely sweet taste, and a soft velvety texture.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Strength<BR>\r\nFortify Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nFortify Personality<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes the volume on the West Gash.

This series focuses on Vvardenfell's different regions, and the plants most commonly found within them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBoth the Ashlands and Molag Amur are barren rocky wastelands. A few hardy specimens of plant life grow in these regions. These vast, mountainous lands make up a large part of Morrowind. The Ashlands are located in northern Vvardenfell, between the West Gash to the west and the Grazelands to the east, with Red Mountain occupying the southeast corner. Molag Amur is located in the southeast, west of Azura's Coast, and south of the Grazelands. These regions are plagued by ash storms, and many creatures roaming the area are blighted. It is a harsh and dangerous landscape, populated by the hardy and steadfast Ashlander tribes of the Dunmer people.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBittergreen Plant<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough this hardy specimen has made its way into the West Gash region, it is ideally suited to the rocky climes of the Ashlands. This plant has a large thick-husked pod, with several long reaching branches curling from it. On these branches grow small clusters of pointed green leaves that look almost flower-like. Bittergreen \"petals\" are edible, and used to restore intelligence. Redoran nobility use it as a garnish in their dishes. Bittergreen petals have the rare distinction of being the only local substance you can combine with diamonds to produce invisibility potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Intelligence<BR>\r\nInvisibility<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFire Fern<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFire fern is unlike most native flowers in Vvardenfell, as it blooms perennially. This plant requires heat to survive, so it tends to grow in volcanic areas, and near hot-springs and geysers. This flower's deep red petals protects traveler's from heat and fire when placed under the tongue. The fire fern has religious significance for the Tribunal Temple; representing the trials of Lord Vivec, it is symbolic of triumph against near impossible odds.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResist Fire<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nSpell Absorbtion<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLichen<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLichen are found in dry mountainous regions, usually growing on rocks. They are both plants and fungus, a colony of each in symbiosis with one another. They are not uncommon, but are difficult to spot. There are three varieties of lichen: black, green, and red. Each have different alchemical properties, so some are more valued than others. Red lichen has a higher value when bought and sold by alchemists. Green lichen is the only type that is edible.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Black Lichen:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nResist Frost<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Green Lichen:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Personality<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Red Lichen<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nLight<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScathecraw Plant<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScathecraw is a type of fern with deep purplish-red leaves. Ashlanders use these tall broad leaves to wrap and preserve food. Scathecraw plants are also found adorning homes in Redoran settlements. Scathecraw is abundant in the rocky regions of Vvardenfell, bringing life to an otherwise barren landscape. The people of Ald'Ruhn often say, \"Scathecraw's simple beauty is here to remind us that life is worth living, even in the harshest and darkest of times.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nRestore Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTrama Root<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTrama root is the primary staple food of the Ashlanders. This long, twisting root is covered in rows of purplish spikes. Though tough on its exterior, breaking off one of these spines reveals a soft, edible center. It is not the best tasting, being slightly bitter, but it is sustaining. Without the simple trama root, the Ashlanders could not live off the land in the unforgiving Ashlands. This abundant tuber is also a key component in levitation potions, making it high in demand in Telvanni cities.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Willpower<BR>\r\nLevitate<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes the volume on the Ashlands and Molag Amur.

Due east of the barren Ashlands, the Grazelands are protected from ash storms by a vast mountain range. Stoneflowers, previously covered in the West Gash volume, also grow in this temperate, semi-arid region. Though there is not much floral variety in this area, there is certainly abundance. The soil is fertile, perfect for farmland, but the land remains wild and untamed. This pastoral landscape is fraught with danger, as it it also home to roaming Daedra. Locals fear to stray too far from the roads, sticking closely to established settlements. There are also several Ashlander camps in this region.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHackle-Lo<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHackle-lo is a large palm, consisting of a trunk of soft prickly fibers topped by a frond of long green leaves. Coastal hackle-lo are often shorter and look like ferns, due to environmental differences in light levels, predators, and competition. Though hackle-lo is found across Vvardenfell's coastal regions, it thrives in the southern Grazelands near Falensarano. Here, the hackle-lo stand tall as they did, across the continent, in ages past. Hackle-lo is in danger of extinction as the Ashlands creep ever closer to the coasts. Despite hackle-lo's rough exterior, this plant is delicate, and ash storms are deadly to it. Despite the plant's dwindling numbers, hackle-lo leaf remains a common local food source.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nWater Breathing<BR>\r\nRestore Luck<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWickwheat<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grazelands thrives with wickwheat, growing like weeds in the area. It is the most abundant plant in Vvardenfell, yet it is hardly used as a common food source. More Dunmer use wickwheat to patch their roofs than eat it; one wonders why. It has restorative properties when eaten, and makes fine bread. However, most locals prefer bread made with saltrice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nFortify Willpower<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nDamage Intelligence<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes the volume on the Grazelands.

This series focuses on Vvardenfell's different regions, and the plants most commonly found within them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAzura's Coast is the preferred location for Telvanni settlements, as the environment is more conducive to growing their tall mushroom towers. The region stretches from the southeasternmost tip of the continent, across the western coast, and into Zafirbel Bay. Azura's Coast is named after the Shrine of Azura. Both it and Sheogorad are lands of wild magic and roaming Daedra. Sheogorad, commonly known for its largest settlement Dagon Fel, is the chain of Vvardenfell's northernmost islands. Both these regions have similar coastal flora, tall mushroom trees and tangled reeds, though they are found in more abundance to the south.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKreshweed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKreshweed grows along Azura's Coast, and to a lesser extent the West Gash and Sheogorad. Its preferred habitat is near saline coastal waters. It can be difficult to discern from other course grasses in the area. Its leaves are long, broad, flat, and fan upwards from the base of the stem. When in bloom, it can be identified by pale yellow trumpet-shaped flowers. Kreshweed fiber has modest alchemical properties. Known locally as \"luck weed,\" it has restorative properties to match. Vos peasants sew kresh fibers into their clothing, but it has no beneficial effect unless consumed or distilled into a potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Luck<BR>\r\nFortify Personality<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow is a tall reed that grows across the coastal regions, and is also farmed in the Ascadian Isles. It is a common food source throughout Vvardenfall. Its marrow is quite sweet. It is the preferred flavoring for most local dishes, or can be eaten raw. It is often given to pacify children. Marshmarrow prefers wet climates and grows best in shallow water. It has restorative properties similar to wickwheat, which can be used in combination to create potions to restore health.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nDetect Enchantment<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMucksponge<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMucksponge once grew in abundance across Vvardenfall. The legend of Vivec in the Fields of Kummu tells how he helped a poor farmer shovel muck, but mucksponge cannot be found in the region today. Mucksponge needs wet climes to survive. Though it is primarily found growing wild along Azura's Coast, it is also cultivated on the north-easternmost coast of the West Gash near Gnisis. Mucksponge is a tall whitish pod with mottled brown spots. Its large cavity in the top is filled with muck, which is harvested using shovels. Mucksponge can produce on average up to 5 tons of muck per year. When it is not harvested, the cavity fills until it runs over onto the soil, which fertilizes nearby plant growth. Muck is used to fortify soil for other crops. As the farmer's friend, the lowly mucksponge has a revered place in Morrowind's history. Muck, not the flesh of the sponge itself, has alchemical properties.\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Intelligence<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSaltrice is the primary staple food across Vvardenfall. It grows wild along the shores of Azura's Coast, and in abundance in Zafirbel Bay. It is also cultivated on farms in the Ascadian Isles. Saltrice has a long history, considered a holy staple by the Tribunal Temple. It is the only food allowed to Temple initiates during certain months of the year, because it is associated with austerity, and purity of body and soul. Saltrice's name derives from its salty flavor, due to drawing in salt from the seawater it typically thrives in. The Saltrice plant has long, broad green leaves. The head of rice is coated in a light pink husk. It has natural restorative properties. It can be eaten raw, but is more often cooked in numerous local dishes. Bread made from saltrice gains its primary restorative property. In alchemy it is has many positive properties, and is otherwise fairly neutral. It is often added to potions to level out their weight, since it is light, inexpensive, and abundant.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nFortify Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nRestore Heath<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFlowers native to the Ascadian Isles, such as willow flower and gold kanet, also grow in these regions, but not in great abundance. Thus concludes the Vvardenfell Flora series. For my next book, I will travel to Mournhold on the Morrowind mainland to seek out its natural plant life. Until then, dear reader.<BR>"

This book covers the few notable species native to its unique habitat. Many are hunted for their alchemical properties, which are also listed here. This book should serve well as a guide for the hunter, the alchemist, and the aspiring naturalist.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Alit<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe alit is a large two-legged beast with a thick rugged hide. Due to its lack of tail, the animal appears top-heavy and clumsy, but it can be incredibly fast when riled. This beast has a similar appearance to the kagouti, but without the tail, tusks, and head crest. Its eyes are small, so it relies mainly on its sense of smell. This animal, like the kagouti, is omnivorous. It feeds mainly on plants and small animals, but will willingly take a chunk of meat out of an unwary traveler. Its two large lower fangs make it a dangerous beast to cross paths with.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe alit is normally harmless, unless surprised, which is easily done. The diseased and blighted variety, which is unfortunately common these days, is far more aggressive, and has a poisonous bite. When the alit attacks, it prefers to charge, bearing its enormous weight down on its victim. It then commences to chew on its prey slowly. It is not difficult for the hardy hunter to kill, but should be avoided by the casual traveler.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe alit only mates once a year, and is extremely dangerous at this time. Females are most dangerous, and will charge anything within range of its smell. Males prefer to charge the females, tending to ignore anything else in the area.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlit meat is tough and inedible, but its hide has many alchemical uses. Its most interesting property is telekinesis. The full alchemical properties of alit hide are as follows:\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Intelligence<BR>\r\nResist Poison<BR>\r\nTelekinesis<BR>\r\nDetect Animal<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCliff Racer<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese large bird-like creatures are the bane of every traveler. They are fast and aggressive, and attack without provocation. They attack with their long barbed tail, which is bereft of any feathering. They have an average wing span of three meters, and two large fins on their body -- the dorsal one being the larger. Their heads are relatively small, their brain being about the size of a comberry. They only have one thought: everything that moves equals food. They have been known to take on animals much larger than themselves, and usually lose.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCliff racers can be heard from a long distance, but stop squawking to sneak up on its prey. You'll often not notice one until it's right on top of you. Its squawking is perhaps the most annoying sound ever heard, and is best shut up by a single heavily enchanted arrow to the throat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCliff racers are prolific breeders. It is always mating season for these birds, and it is only their constant attacks on armed travelers, and creatures bigger and nastier than itself, that keeps this bird from overrunning the ecosystem. If an area is left unhunted for too long, such as in the high mountainous Ashlands, an unwary traveler will soon find himself swarmed by dozens of them. They are not difficult to kill individually, but when they swarm they can pick a man clean to the bone in a matter of minutes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCliff racers are useful for their plumes, which are used by alchemists in potions of levitation. This is perhaps the only quality which excuses the existence of this horrible creature. If it were possible to hunt these creatures to extinction, I'm sure there would be teams of hunters trying to do just that. The alchemical properties of their plumes are few, and the levitate effect is their only real use:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\nLevitate<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDreugh<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDreugh are reddish colored, semi-humanoid beasts with four long tentacles instead of legs. They are highly intelligent, and live in deep waters along coastal areas. They often attack fishermen without provocation. Dreugh feed mainly on slaughterfish, which are highly aggressive prey. The dreugh has four clawed arms. It uses its main claw, larger than the others, for both attack and defense.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe dreugh's mating habits are mysterious, since no naturalist has been able to get close enough to observe it. It likely takes place in the dark underwater caves located all around the coastal waters rather than open water, as this is a safer place to lay their eggs -- if they do indeed lay eggs. None have ever been found.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDreugh wax, harvested by the hardier fishermen of Morrowind, is prized for its alchemical properties. It comes from scraping the inside of the dreugh's shell, which is also used to make armor. The properties of the wax are as follows:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Strength<BR>\r\nRestore Strength<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGuar<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGuars are large animals that walk on two sturdy hind legs. Its two smaller fore-legs are used for digging up roots and tubers. It is a steadfast beast of burden. Tamed guars are placid and often used by farmers to dig up corkbulb root, which happens to be its favorite food. It has a keen sense of smell, and can smell these roots from miles away.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Ashlanders raise herds of guar, and Dunmer traders typically use them as pack animals. Their thick hide is also a common commodity. The rare White Guar is a magnificent rare variety of this species. It is rumored to live somewhere in the northern Grazelands, and is honored among the Ashlander tribes as a sacred animal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWild guar tend to be aggressive, and will attack passing travelers. Their bite is powerful enough to take a man's arm clean off. Their large weight can overpower even the hardiest traveler. Guars are typically more aggressive during the mating season, which happens once a year during the rainy season.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGuar hide is traded extensively throughout the Ashlands and has several alchemical properties. These include:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nFartify Endurance<BR>\r\nRestore Personality<BR>\r\nFortify Luck<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKagouti<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough I intend to make a fuller study of the kagouti and their mating habits, I have enough information to touch on them here. The kagouti is a species related to the alit, but far more aggressive and dangerous. The kagouti stands on two powerful hind legs, much like the alit, but has a large tail to aid its balance; therefore, it can run much faster than its slower, clumsier cousin. The kagouti has a reddish mottled coloration, and a magnificent crest on the back of its skull, which it uses in its mating displays. It has two large tusks protruding from the sides of its mouth, and a small horn on the end of its snout.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe kagouti is incredibly fast, therefore dangerous to unwary travelers. When they charge, they use their massive tusks to gore. Though they are omnivorous, they prefer fresh meat. The kagouti has far better sight than the alit, but it seems to detect motion rather than form and color. It uses this, in conjunction with its sense of smell, to tell whether or not it is charging prey or a fellow kagouti. Its mating habits require further study by yours truly, but they seem to be more prolific compared to alit.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe hide of the kagouti has a few notable alchemical properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nFortify Speed<BR>\r\nResist Common Disease<BR>\r\nNight Eye<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKwama<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKwama come in many varieties, each having a specific role in its hive society. The kwama queen is the only member of the species that lays eggs, and other kwama are dedicated to protecting her; kwama warriors have this exclusive role. Kwama workers are dedicated to tending the queen and her eggs. These three kwama types rarely leave their hives. In fact, the queen is so large she is completely immobile. Unfortunately, egg mining is a serious business, so I'm told, and I have been barred from publishing further details on the characteristics and breeding of kwama.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe two other types, kwama foragers and scribs, are the only kind that stray far from the hive. The scrib is an immature form of kwama, and relatively harmless. When provoked, it defends itself with a paralyzing bite, but does little damage. The kwama forager is the only aggressive member of the species. It emits a cloud of fumes that doesn't seem to do much damage. The creatures are more annoying than dangerous. It is often found far outside of eggmines, and can traverse large distances.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKwama cuttle is harvested from these creature's internal shells. Eaten raw, it can be used to resist poison, and has other minor alchemical uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResist Poison<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nWater Walking<BR>\r\nWater Breathing<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKwama eggs come in large and small varieties. The smaller kind carries only the first alchemical property of the larger variety:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nFrost Shield<BR>\r\nFortify Health<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScribs have not yet developed cuttle, but their internal jelly has unique alchemical properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Willpower<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\nCure Blight Disease<BR>\r\nRestore Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMudcrab<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe mudcrab is a relatively mundane creature that lives on the coastal regions all over Morrowind. It can be found scavenging in the mud for small plants and animals. It is weak and slow, and not normally aggressive. However, the variety found in Vvardenfell shows unusual aggressive tendencies.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe mating habits of the mudcrab are the one truly interesting feature of this creature, involving a complex ritual of gestures and calls. It is the author's theory that their mating rituals are complicated due to a complete lack of visible sexual differentiation. Mudcrabs are in fact androgynous, and this ritual seems to determine which role each particular mudcrab will take during each mating season. The mating seasons are semi-annual, but last many months, and a single mudcrab will lay several hundred eggs per season. Mudcrabs happen to be the favorite food source of coastal cliff racers, so they tend to bury their eggs deep in the sand. The \"mother\" mudcrab with guard this area until they hatch, and attack any other animal that approaches.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFishermen often catch swamp fever from these creatures, as they are dirty bottom-feeding crustaceans. Nevertheless, their meat is edible, and surprisingly sweet and tasty. It is however an acquired taste, as it has an unusual aftertaste. It is not widely popular outside of coastal regions. Crab meat has a few interesting alchemical properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nResist Shock<BR>\r\nLightning Shield<BR>\r\nRestore Luck<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNetch<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNetch are a large floating tentacled beasts found throughout Vvardenfell. They are usually passive, found grazing on tall foliage. It prefers coastal regions, particularly around the bitter coast, but can be found just about anywhere. They are migratory animals, and will travel vast distances to get to their annual mating grounds.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMale and female netches, called bulls and betties respectively, are highly differentiated. The bull netch is much larger, and happens to be poisonous. The betty netch is the smaller of the two, but typically much meaner. During the mating season, netches can become aggressive, especially if approached during their mating ritual. Normally betty netches have more than one breeding parnter, but local netch herders try to curb this tendency so they breed faster, which results in greater aggression in the females.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNetch leather is widely traded throughout the continent, and are even bred for the purpose. It has several interesting alchemical properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Endurance<BR>\r\nFortify Intelligence<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nCure Paralyzation<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNix-Hound<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNix-hounds are notorious for terrorizing the locals. It is a highly aggressive beast and often hunts in large packs. These animals are not at all shy of people, and only the constant effort of town watches keeps them from over-running the local population. These beasts get into mines, terrorize the miners, and can devastate a kwama mine. They are also the bane of farmers, for they often kill livestock in the middle of the night. These hideous beasts have large red eyes on stalks, which are keen, and a long pointed snout. They have two sharp protuberances originating from the mouth. They attack with their fore-paws, and their claws are incredibly sharp.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis author currently has little information on the nix-hound's mating habits, but they certainly know what they're doing. They are prolific, and can live in just about any environment. Blighted nix-hounds are tougher and even more aggressive, if such a thing is imaginable.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHound meat is a staple food of Vvardenfell, and it isn't at all bad. It's sweet and tender, doesn't take much cooking, and comberry or saltrice can be used to flavor it. The meat also has some notable alchemical properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nFortify Fatigue<BR>\r\nReflect<BR>\r\nDetect Enchantment<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRat<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe rats of Morrowind are large and aggressive. They are easily dealt with -- a few sturdy kicks to the head will do one in. They will attack anyone, and often get themselves killed this way. Nevertheless, there's a widespread proliferation of them. They are particularly attracted to stores of dried saltrice, so the little nasties tend to get into people's pantries.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe cave rat is sturdier and more dangerous to deal with. They are typically found in dark places, and will attack on sight. Though rats are easy enough to kill, they are often blighted, and spread all sorts of diseases. If their populations are not controlled, they can plague entire towns.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRat meat is commonly cooked and eaten, though it's unhealthy unless boiled into shoe leather. It is not an appetizing dish, usually only eaten by the poor. This meat however has a few alchemical properties worth mentioning:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\nResist Poison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShalk<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe shalk is a large black cave-dwelling beetle, often found foraging above ground in mountainous areas. It is aggressive, but not terribly dangerous. It attacks using both its pincers and a magical firebite. It is immune to fire spells, but has a weakness to cold.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe shalk is a long-lived creature, and only mates every hundred years. Its eggs can stay dormant just as long, and shalk lay so many during the mating season that they hatch steadily over the course of the next century. During the mating period, shalk are said to gather at the call of a \"king shalk\" to its chosen mating grounds, typically a cave with a large food source. The king shalk is not born as such; it is a mystery how an ordinary shalk becomes one when the time arises. It is this author's supposition that it is caused by excess growth through prolonged exposure to magical cave crystals, or perhaps a symptom of gorging itself on the bloatspores that grow in the presence of such crystals. Locals say the king shalk is eaten by the others. However, this theory remains unproven until a live king shalk is observed. This author, Edras Oril, asks to be informed of any living king shalk found, or at least given the opportunity to study any resin taken from one.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShalk resin is a tough, soluble substance which is extracted from the shalk's carapace. It is used as glues and stiffeners in the manufacture of certain types of armor. It also fetches a decent price from alchemists, as it has some useful alchemical properties, as follows:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nFortify Health<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSlaughterfish<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSlaughterfish, of both the large and small varieties, are highly aggressive, and will attack a traveler the moment he puts a foot in the water. Their needle-sharp teeth can strip flesh in a matter of seconds. They are surprisingly intelligent, and adept hunters. The smaller variety are omnivorous, while the larger variety are carnivores. They do not seem to consider dreugh prey, which tend to inhabit the same waters, perhaps because they're smart enough to know the dreugh are the ones hunting them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe mating habits of the slaughterfish have not been extensively studied, but it is known that they have fairly complex mating rituals. They do not protect their eggs at all, preferring to lay them in deep dark crevasses and caves, usually close to sources of kelp.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSlaughterfish scales are cut away and used in alchemy, mainly in water walking potions, but also for potions of swift swim. Both potions are useful for avoiding slaughterfish when traveling across water. The full list of alchemical properties for scales are as follows:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nWater Walking<BR>\r\nRestore Endurance<BR>\r\nSwift Swim<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn a future installment, this author intends to travel to the region of Mournhold, primarily to study the magnificent durzog. This tough four-legged beast has a large plated skull covered in a thick leathery hide, along with two large fangs and tusks, and a long spiky tail. I intend to make a full study of this creature's mating habits and characteristics. In the meantime, the alchemical properties of its meat is known to be:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Agility<BR>\r\nFortify Strength<BR>\r\nBlind<BR>\r\nDamage Magkica<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes my treatise on the fascinating fauna of Vvardenfell. I invite any aspiring naturalists in the area to seek me out, as I always enjoy conversing with fellow nature enthusiasts.<BR>"

As you may know, kwama eggs are a staple food of the dunmer. Their large size, thick shells, and long shelf-life make them ideal eggs for exporting. With increased production, we could soon make them available to other Imperial nations.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFirst of all, I propose to the Emperor's council, that killing a kwama queen be made illegal, punishable by severe fines and long jail sentences. The kwama queen is the heart of the colony, and there have been several cases of terrorism targeted against them. Members of the Dunmer Great Houses have taken to killing kwama queens in enemy mines to halt their production. Attacks on Imperial mines are surely in the coming. If we make the penalties harsh, we may quell this form of economic warfare before it gets out of hand.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nControlling Kwama Populations and Disease<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBlight diseases are constantly infiltrating our mines. When blight gets out of control, our miners are forced to halt production and abandon the mines. We must make efforts to cure the infected queens and to put down the other disease carriers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe kwama forager has become the worst enemy of the mines. This creature spends it time outside scouting for new territory, and is often the source of blight being brought into the mines. Their population must be controlled. Kill them all and harvest them for their cuttle, I say.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBlighted and otherwise diseased kwama workers must be put down immediately before they spread disease to the rest of the population. As essential as the workers are to egg production, those that are diseased must be sacrificed to spare the rest of the colony. It is not cost effective to cure them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBlighted scribs must be treated similarly. Those harmless little scribs aren't so harmless when they're carrying disease into the mines. There will always be plenty scribs to go around, so kill the few problem ones and harvest them for their jelly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOn the Hiring and Practices of Miners<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOur head office insists on shuffling miners from one mine to another, and this has got to stop. I don't know who got the stupid idea of rotating miners from mine to mine, but it has been detrimental to egg production. This is likely due to silly quill pushing administrators running the lot, and not knowing a damn thing about the practice of egg mining. I'll lay it out for you people here.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKwama recognize each other by smell. Over time they get used to the smell of the miners and accept them into the colony. When there are strangers in the mine, kwama workers get nervous, and when the workers are nervous, they don't work. Unfamiliar miners also have to spend their time fending off attacks from kwama warriors and foragers, and that's not just bad for production, it's bad for moral.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere is a practice in the mines when a new hire is getting acclimatized: he smothers himself in scrib jelly to disguise his smell until the kwama get used to him. This man is called a \"scrib\" by the other miners, and he stinks -- constantly. Even an experienced miner has to do this if he is moved to another mine, and though he knows damn well he has to do it, it is an insult to his experience.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen morale is low, production is low. You people have been shuffling miners around like game pieces, uprooting them from their homes, and turning experienced miners into scribs, and you don't think there's a morale problem?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe dunmer don't shuffle their miners around. They work in the same mine their whole lives. This isn't some barbarian practice, it just makes sense to do things that way. They've been mining eggs for years, so why should you bloody quill pushers think you know any better?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThat is all I have to say on the subject. Imperial mine production has been under quota for years and I'm telling you people how to fix things. It's just as simple as I say it is, so either take my advice, or disappoint the Emperor. It's your choice.<BR>"

Once abundant in the Bitter Coast region, it is now incredibly rare. Today, Bloatspore only grows in caves. Unlike other fungus, it parasitizes other fungus rather than plants. It also needs magicka to survive, which it once received from Magnus' light. Since their populations spread into caves, they are usually found clustered near magicka crystals. Due to its odd nature, scholars have long debated whether it is in fact a plant or a fungus.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBloatspore can be grown indoors if planted with other types of fungus near a steady magicka source. Some alchemists to grow their own this way, as it is difficult to hunt for, but it takes skill and careful tending. Most alchemists instead rely on Telvanni cultivated Bloatspores, or Bloat imported from the Black Marshes for their supply. Bloat is in high demand amongst mages due to its alchemical properties.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nFortify Intelligence<BR>\r\nFortify Willpower<BR>\r\nDetect Animal<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDue to the Blight storms in Vvardenfell, the Bloatspore has become nearly extinct across the province. As a result, the Shalk, for which Bloat was once its primary food source, has become an aggressive creature. These insects have become a problem in the region, roaming outside their natural cave habitats to attack towns and travellers. With the decrease in Bloatspore population, and the threat of Shalks devouring the few remaining, alchemists have come to prize this rare spore, and cultivate and preserve its last remaining habitats.<BR>"

The area around Mournhold ranges from temperate to semi-arid, and supports a large variety of plant life. Of those I encountered, I will list the most noteworthy here -- that is, the species of flora with the most interest to alchemists. I intend to more thoroughly explore the continent in the future, but until then, this list includes the flora most commonly found within Mournhold's city walls.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHorn Lily<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe horn lily is an elegant violet flower. The petals form a large bell, and its stamen is long and pointed. Its leaves and stem are thin and long. Its soft petals are thick and have a velvety texture. The bulb of the horn lily has some interesting alchemical properties, and is traded throughout the area.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResist Paralysis<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nRestore Strength<BR>\r\nRestore Endurance<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMeadow Rye<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMeadow rye is a tall grain. Its sheaf varies in color from light grey-blue to light greyish-pink. It prefers to grow in temperate climes, in shady areas near trees, but can also survive in semi-arid climates. People can increase their speed by eating meadow rye grain. It can be eaten raw, but is more often baked into bread and other local dishes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Speed<BR>\r\nDamage Health<BR>\r\nRestore Speed<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNirthfly Stalks<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe nirthfly is a flower with bright golden petals. These petals appear ragged, and have the texture of downy feathers. The leaves are long and smooth, and originate from the base of the stem. Nirthfly stalks are naturally poisonous, but have more favorable properties when mixed into potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDamage Health<BR>\r\nFortify Speed<BR>\r\nRestore Speed<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScrib Cabbage<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScrib cabbage is a large cabbage with thick green leaves. Though it apparently tastes good, it has unwanted side effects when eaten. In Mournhold, it is used as a garnish rather than eaten.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Intelligence<BR>\r\nDamage Health<BR>\r\nRestore Agility<BR>\r\nFortify Agility<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSpiny Lloramor<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSpiny lloramor is a large variety of prickle plant, which can grow up to seven feet tall. It tends to grow in arid and semi-arid climates. The lloramor often branches out, and its spines are long and needle sharp. Lloramor spines have an interesting property when they prick the skin, giving a person the ability to absorb spells for a short period of time. This effect makes them useful for potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSpell Absorbtion<BR>\r\nInvisibility<BR>\r\nPoison<BR>\r\nDetect Enchantment<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSweetbarrel<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSweetbarrel is a small prickly plant that grows in the more arid climes around Mournhold. When in bloom, it sprouts large flowers from its top. These flowers are bell shaped and have slick, shiny, angular petals. The coloration of the petals are yellow at the base and an orange-red at the tip. The large trunk of the plant has a thick leathery skin, protecting the watery pulp inside. Local hunters dip their arrowheads into the poisonous pulp because it has a strong paralysis effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nLevitate<BR>\r\nResist Paralysis<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTimsa-Come-By Flowers<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTimsa-come-by is a tiny pink flower that sit in clusters atop a tall stem. The leaves originate from the stem in a radial pattern. When the flower is placed in the mouth, it dispels magic effects.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDispel<BR>\r\nResist Paralysis<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nRestore Endurance<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough there is plenty more varieties of flora on the Morrowind mainland, it will have to be covered in another volume. Until then, dear reader.<BR>"

This book focuses on Vvardenfell's different regions, and the plants most commonly found within them. Each region is divided into the following sections:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: The Bitter Coast<BR>\r\nSection Two: The Ascadian Isles<BR>\r\nSection Three: West Gash<BR>\r\nSection Four: The Ashlands and Molag Amur<BR>\r\nSection Five: Grazelands<BR>\r\nSection Six: Azura's Coast and Sheogorad<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: The Bitter Coast<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Bitter Coast runs along the southeastern edge of Vvardenfell. Most flora in this region is of the fungal variety, which glows with mysterious beauty in the dark marshes. The region's native plants thrive in heavy rainfall, which has kept this ecosystem in balance, and relatively safe against the Blight, for thousands of years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBungler's Bane<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis fungal shelf is found growing on trees alongside its cousin hypa facia. It is distinguished by mottled coloration, compared to its lighter, smoother cousin. This fungus is poisonous, but can be used in dispel potions when mixed appropriately.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nDispel<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDraggle Tail<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDraggle tail is a marsh weed found growing deep in the green marshes of the Bitter Coast. Often one will find an ampoule pod, the draggle tail's immature fruiting body, on the end of a thick stalk. The large bulbous pod has a soft blue glow. Though the ampoule pod develops from the coda flower, the draggle tail's alchemical properties change from flower to fruit. The pod is easier for the novice herbalist to gather than the delicate coda flower.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe coda flower has a bright blue glow, prized by alchemists and florists alike. Poor fishermen along the Bitter Coast often place the flowers in their homes when candles are in short supply, but it has gradually found its way into upper class homes due to its beauty, and its association with the Shrine to Stop the Moon. The coda flower is symbolic of enlightenment. It has only one use in alchemy, but as levitation potions are in high demand, that one use makes it a prized ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Ampoule Pod:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWater walking<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nDetect Animal<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Coda Flower:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nLevitate<BR>\r\nDrain Intelligence<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHypha Fascia<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLike bungler's bane, this fungal shelf is found growing on trees and wet marshy rocks. Its lighter, smoother coloration distinguishes it from its cousin. It is also poisonous when ingested. Its only alchemical use is in detect enchantment potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nDetect Enchantment<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLuminous Russula<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis dark mottled mushroom is large and odorous, and has a faint luminosity, as its name suggests. These mushrooms are often found tucked into rocks along the coast, and in dark caverns across Vvardenfell. When placed in the mouth, it allows one to breath water for a short period. It is used extensively by local pearl divers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWater Breathing<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nPoison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSpore Pod<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis thick bulbous pod is found growing on the slough fern. It is tough and inedible, but has a singular use in detect key potions. As an alchemical commodity, it is not in high demand, and often not worth gathering. It also takes a good amount of crushing to remove the jelly from its thick skin.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nViolet Coprinus<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis large mushroom has a bright blue skin and is softly luminescent. It is often used in floral displays alongside the coda flower. It is found in dark places alongside luminous russula, and in thick marshes where draggle tail grows. When ingested, it allows the traveler to walk lightly on water.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWater Walking<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nPoison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: The Ascadian Isles<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNorth of the Bitter Coast is the beautiful Ascadian Isles. This area is a favorite of Imperial tourists, as it most closely reminds them of home. This region's rich soil provides for an abundance of beautiful flowers and staple crops. Local farmers harvest staple foods such as saltrice and marshmarrow, and grow flowering plants for herbal remedies. If you happen to be in the area, make sure to visit the Fields of Kummu. This local shrine is teeming with local wildlife, lovingly preserved in its natural state by the Tribunal Temple for hundreds of years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh yams are not found in the wild, but grown extensively on farms throughout the area. This sweet tuber is a staple food throughout Vvardenfell. The large purplish tuber is recognizable by spiky leaves sticking out of its top. The tuber grows so large, it bursts from the ground until its bulb pokes halfway out of the soil. When eaten, it temporarily heightens awareness, but it has many other alchemical uses when distilled into potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Intelligence<BR>\r\nFortify Strength<BR>\r\nResist Common Disease<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBlack Anther<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis local flower has large open petals with dark violet tips, and a long stamen. The dark heavy leaves of this tall flower often point towards the ground. The beauty of this flower is undeniable. However, it is not often used in floral displays because it symbolizes sexual desire and betrayal. It is the flower of the vamp, an image popularized by the song \"Black Anther (the Vampiress)\" by the bard Jademis Crowl. The stamens are collected by alchemists, though their use is limited.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nResist Fire<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nLight<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe comberry bush has bright red berries, used in many local recipes and brews. Uncooked comberry causes fatigue, which is useful for sleeping draughts. The comberry has a slight bitter aftertaste and is incredibly tart, but other than the ash yam, has the sweetest flavor found in Vvardenfell. It is found in the wild and on local farms. Distilled comberry has many alchemical uses.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nRestore Magica<BR>\r\nFire Shield<BR>\r\nReflect<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis tuber is another staple food, found in the wild and on local farms. It is larger than the ash yam, and has a tougher hide. Its leaves are large, wide, and forms a parasol over the the large bulb. Corkbulb grows deep in the soil, and is somewhat difficult to dig up; farmers often employ tamed guars for the purpose. Corkbulb root is the guar's favorite meal, and this animal can smell it from a mile away. Be aware that wild guars will attack if you are carrying corkbulb root on your person. Besides being a tasty and nutritous food, this root is also a useful alchemical ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCure Paralyzation<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nLightning Shield<BR>\r\nFortify Luck<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGold Kanet<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGold kanet's small golden flowers grow in clusters atop a large thick stem. Its large wide fan-like leaves are dark green, its lush foliage bush-like. Gold kanet traditionally symbolizes long lasting friendship, and dried cuttings from this flower are often given as a symbolic gesture. It is also a symbol of loyalty, worn by candidates during oath of service ceremonies of the Indoril and Ordinators. The famed gold kanet flower Roland's Tear is found in a small remote part of the Ascadian Isles; its exact location is unknown. Despite its symbolic importance in Vvardenfell, the alchemical uses of this flower are limited, only good for potions to restore strength. Since its primary alchemical properties are detrimental to health and well being, it must be carefully prepared for use in potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nBurden<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nRestore Strength<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeather<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeather is a small cluster of pink flowers that grow close to the ground. Its leaves are small and spiny, which make it quite painful to pick. Heather is symbolic of young idyllic love and shy admiration; the young often leave it anonymously on the doorsteps of their sweethearts. When a young man or woman is caught daydreaming, they are often told they are \"out picking heather.\" Heather is picked fresh and eaten during times of heartbreak, as it is said to restore one's confidence and lighten one's burdens. In alchemy, heather is most often used in potions of feather.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Personality<BR>\r\nFeather<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWillow Flower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWillow flowers are large, with clusters of soft white anthers cupped in broad pinkish-red leaves. The leaves are folded in the middle, forming what is described as an \"upside-down cup\" or \"capsized boat.\" In Vvardenfell, the willow flower is worn by a bride on her wedding day, as it symbolizes purity and devotion. The flower's anthers have many alchemical uses.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nFrost Shield<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nCure Paralyzation<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Three: The West Gash<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe West Gash region is located near the western coast of Vvardenfell. It runs all the way from the north to the mountains of the Ascadian Isles. Is is sandwiched between two mountain ranges: the Bitter Coast to the southwest, and the rocky Ashlands to the west. Its climate is semi-arid, but still affords a beautiful landscape teeming with life.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChokeweed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChokeweed is the most common plant found in this area, named thus because its overgrowth tends to block off roads and mountainous passages. It is a tall, straight bush-like plant, with fans of sharp pointy leaves that look like lace. The leaves are tough and difficult to cut from the branches. Despite its reputation as \"the unlucky leaf,\" it has its uses in alchemy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRoobrush<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough roobrush appears similar to chokeweed, its fans of foliage are broader and covered in numerous small, flat leaves. It does not grow as tall or straight as chokeweed, and is distinguished by its tough greenish-orange fruit. This fruit is not edible, but it has alchemical uses. It is often used as a poison that, when administered to strong drink, is meant to drain the willpower of your enemies and kill them slowly. Roobrush poison has been used extensively in the centuries long feuds between the great houses of Morrowind.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\nFortify Agility<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStoneflower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe stoneflower is also found in the wilds of the Ascadian Isles, but it is a true native of the West Gash. The rich blue flowers are prolific there, for they have little competition. Conical in shape, with pointed petals, the large heavy flowers bend towards the ground. The leaves are similar to the willow flower; the two species may be related. Stoneflower traditionally represents death and mourning, so it is often use in Dunmer funeral cerimonies. The petals have varied uses in alchemy, and they are also edible. They have a vaguely sweet taste, and a soft velvety texture.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Strength<BR>\r\nFortify Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\nFortify Personality<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Four: The Ashlands and Molag Amur<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBoth the Ashlands and Molag Amur are barren rocky wastelands. A few hardy specimens of plant life grow in these regions. These vast, mountainous lands make up a large part of Morrowind. The Ashlands are located in northern Vvardenfell, between the West Gash to the west and the Grazelands to the east, with Red Mountain occupying the southeast corner. Molag Amur is located in the southeast, west of Azura's Coast, and south of the Grazelands. These regions are plagued by ash storms, and many creatures roaming the area are blighted. It is a harsh and dangerous landscape, populated by the hardy and steadfast Ashlander tribes of the Dunmer people.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBittergreen Plant<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough this hardy specimen has made its way into the West Gash region, it is ideally suited to the rocky climes of the Ashlands. This plant has a large thick-husked pod, with several long reaching branches curling from it. On these branches grow small clusters of pointed green leaves that look almost flower-like. Bittergreen \"petals\" are edible, and used to restore intelligence. Redoran nobility use it as a garnish in their dishes. Bittergreen petals have the rare distinction of being the only local substance you can combine with diamonds to produce invisibility potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Intelligence<BR>\r\nInvisibility<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFire Fern<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFire fern is unlike most native flowers in Vvardenfell, as it blooms perennially. This plant requires heat to survive, so it tends to grow in volcanic areas, and near hot-springs and geysers. This flower's deep red petals protects traveler's from heat and fire when placed under the tongue. The fire fern has religious significance for the Tribunal Temple; representing the trials of Lord Vivec, it is symbolic of triumph against near impossible odds.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResist Fire<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nSpell Absorbtion<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLichen<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLichen are found in dry mountainous regions, usually growing on rocks. They are both plants and fungus, a colony of each in symbiosis with one another. They are not uncommon, but are difficult to spot. There are three varieties of lichen: black, green, and red. Each have different alchemical properties, so some are more valued than others. Red lichen has a higher value when bought and sold by alchemists. Green lichen is the only type that is edible.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Black Lichen:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nResist Frost<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Green Lichen:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFortify Personality<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties -- Red Lichen<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nLight<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScathecraw Plant<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScathecraw is a type of fern with deep purplish-red leaves. Ashlanders use these tall broad leaves to wrap and preserve food. Scathecraw plants are also found adorning homes in Redoran settlements. Scathecraw is abundant in the rocky regions of Vvardenfell, bringing life to an otherwise barren landscape. The people of Ald'Ruhn often say, \"Scathecraw's simple beauty is here to remind us that life is worth living, even in the harshest and darkest of times.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nRestore Willpower<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTrama Root<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTrama root is the primary staple food of the Ashlanders. This long, twisting root is covered in rows of purplish spikes. Though tough on its exterior, breaking off one of these spines reveals a soft, edible center. It is not the best tasting, being slightly bitter, but it is sustaining. Without the simple trama root, the Ashlanders could not live off the land in the unforgiving Ashlands. This abundant tuber is also a key component in levitation potions, making it high in demand in Telvanni cities.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Willpower<BR>\r\nLevitate<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Five: The Grazelands<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grazelands are grassy plains on the northeastern edge of Vvardenfell. Due east of the barren Ashlands, the Grazelands are protected from ash storms by a vast mountain range. Stoneflowers, previously covered in the West Gash chapter, also grow in this temperate, semi-arid region. Though there is not much floral variety in this area, there is certainly abundance. The soil is fertile, perfect for farmland, but the land remains wild and untamed. This pastoral landscape is fraught with danger, as it it also home to roaming Daedra. Locals fear to stray too far from the roads, sticking closely to established settlements. There are also several Ashlander camps in this region.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHackle-Lo<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHackle-lo is a large palm, consisting of a trunk of soft prickly fibers topped by a frond of long green leaves. Coastal hackle-lo are often shorter and look like ferns, due to environmental differences in light levels, predators, and competition. Though hackle-lo is found across Vvardenfell's coastal regions, it thrives in the southern Grazelands near Falensarano. Here, the hackle-lo stand tall as they did, across the continent, in ages past. Hackle-lo is in danger of extinction as the Ashlands creep ever closer to the coasts. Despite hackle-lo's rough exterior, this plant is delicate, and ash storms are deadly to it. Despite the plant's dwindling numbers, hackle-lo leaf remains a common local food source.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nWater Breathing<BR>\r\nRestore Luck<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWickwheat<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grazelands thrives with wickwheat, growing like weeds in the area. It is the most abundant plant in Vvardenfell, yet it is hardly used as a common food source. More Dunmer use wickwheat to patch their roofs than eat it; one wonders why. It has restorative properties when eaten, and makes fine bread. However, most locals prefer bread made with saltrice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nFortify Willpower<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nDamage Intelligence<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Six: Azura's Coast and Sheogorad<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAzura's Coast is the preferred location for Telvanni settlements, as the environment is more conducive to growing their tall mushroom towers. The region stretches from the southeasternmost tip of the continent, across the western coast, and into Zafirbel Bay. Azura's Coast is named after the Shrine of Azura. Both it and Sheogorad are lands of wild magic and roaming Daedra. Sheogorad, commonly known for its largest settlement Dagon Fel, is the chain of Vvardenfell's northernmost islands. Both these regions have similar coastal flora, tall mushroom trees and tangled reeds, though they are found in more abundance to the south.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKreshweed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKreshweed grows along Azura's Coast, and to a lesser extent the West Gash and Sheogorad. Its preferred habitat is near saline coastal waters. It can be difficult to discern from other course grasses in the area. Its leaves are long, broad, flat, and fan upwards from the base of the stem. When in bloom, it can be identified by pale yellow trumpet-shaped flowers. Kreshweed fiber has modest alchemical properties. Known locally as \"luck weed,\" it has restorative properties to match. Vos peasants sew kresh fibers into their clothing, but it has no beneficial effect unless consumed or distilled into a potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Luck<BR>\r\nFortify Personality<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow is a tall reed that grows across the coastal regions, and is also farmed in the Ascadian Isles. It is a common food source throughout Vvardenfall. Its marrow is quite sweet. It is the preferred flavoring for most local dishes, or can be eaten raw. It is often given to pacify children. Marshmarrow prefers wet climates and grows best in shallow water. It has restorative properties similar to wickwheat, which can be used in combination to create potions to restore health.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nDetect Enchantment<BR>\r\nDrain Willpower<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMucksponge<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMucksponge once grew in abundance across Vvardenfall. The legend of Vivec in the Fields of Kummu tells how he helped a poor farmer shovel muck, but mucksponge cannot be found in the region today. Mucksponge needs wet climes to survive. Though it is primarily found growing wild along Azura's Coast, it is also cultivated on the north-easternmost coast of the West Gash near Gnisis. Mucksponge is a tall whitish pod with mottled brown spots. Its large cavity in the top is filled with muck, which is harvested using shovels. Mucksponge can produce on average up to 5 tons of muck per year. When it is not harvested, the cavity fills until it runs over onto the soil, which fertilizes nearby plant growth. Muck is used to fortify soil for other crops. As the farmer's friend, the lowly mucksponge has a revered place in Morrowind's history. Muck, not the flesh of the sponge itself, has alchemical properties.\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Intelligence<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\nDrain Personality<BR>\r\nCure Common Disease<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSaltrice is the primary staple food across Vvardenfall. It grows wild along the shores of Azura's Coast, and in abundance in Zafirbel Bay. It is also cultivated on farms in the Ascadian Isles. Saltrice has a long history, considered a holy staple by the Tribunal Temple. It is the only food allowed to Temple initiates during certain months of the year, because it is associated with austerity, and purity of body and soul. Saltrice's name derives from its salty flavor, due to drawing in salt from the seawater it typically thrives in. The Saltrice plant has long, broad green leaves. The head of rice is coated in a light pink husk. It has natural restorative properties. It can be eaten raw, but is more often cooked in numerous local dishes. Bread made from saltrice gains its primary restorative property. In alchemy it is has many positive properties, and is otherwise fairly neutral. It is often added to potions to level out their weight, since it is light, inexpensive, and abundant.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Fatigue<BR>\r\nFortify Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nRestore Heath<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFlowers native to the Ascadian Isles, such as willow flower and gold kanet, also grow in these regions, but not in great abundance. Thus concludes the Vvardenfell Flora Compendium. For my next book, I will travel to Mournhold on the Morrowind mainland to seek out its natural plant life. Until then, dear reader.<BR>"

It's divided into six parts based on the earlier editions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart One: Alchemy for Beginners and Basic Restore Potions<BR>\r\nPart Two: Potions of Curing<BR>\r\nPart Three: Potions of Restoration<BR>\r\nPart Four: Potions of Fortification<BR>\r\nPart Five: Potions of Resistance and Shielding<BR>\r\nPart Six: Potions of Magical Effect<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart One: Alchemy for Beginners<BR><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis first section of this book is intended for those with novice skill in alchemy, and explains the general processes involved.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Alchemist's Apparatus<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAn alchemist needs appropriate tools for the job. Below is a list of apparatus available. These can be found of varying quality; the better the quality, the better your potions will be. A mortar and pestle is required for all potion making. The other tools are optional, but you will get better results if you have one of each at your disposal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Mortar and Pestle</FONT><BR>\r\nThis is the most basic apparatus required to mix a potion. Your mortar and pestle's quality also determines the potion's strength. This simple apparatus is a must for any alchemist. To use, simply add your ingredients to the mortar, and stir or grind your ingredients with the pestle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Retort</FONT><BR>\r\nA retort is a basic distillation device used to increase the magnitude and duration of all positive effects in a potion. To use, place the ingredient, preferably in liquid form, in the bulb of the alembic, and heat with a small flame. In time, the distilled ingredient will collect and travel down the spout. This simple process requires little tending, just make sure you have plenty flasks at the ready.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Alembic</FONT><BR>\r\nThe alembic is used to decrease the magnitude and duration of all negative effects in a potion. This tool is necessary if you're forced to work with ingredients that combine negative effects, but unnecessary if there are none. Skooma pipes also make good alembics. The alembic is a distillation apparatus similar to the retort, but instead of one bulb, it has two or three bulbs connected by a tube.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Calcinator</FONT><BR>\r\nThe calcinator increases the magnitude and duration of all effects in a potion. Calcination is the process of heating a substance to just below its melting point. It is often used to drive off water or other volatile constituents, or to oxidize or reduce a substance. Careful experimentation will reveal how much heat and time is required for each ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGeneral Practice<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe easiest way for a beginner to practice alchemy is to sample ingredients. Of course, your skills will grow faster if you successfully mix a potion, but your failure rate will be high until you gain experience. It is best to have basic training before attempting your first potions, otherwise you'll be fumbling blind, and gain little experience in the art. Once you have the basic skills, you can increase your chance of success by fortifying intelligence and luck, allowing even the low skilled to become successful alchemists. You can find these recipes in the section on potions of fortification.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAny two ingredients with similar effect can be used to create a potion; however, some are better combinations than others. Potions effects do not multiply if you use more than two ingredients with the same effect. Multiple effects do occur however if your ingredients combine in more than one way. An alchemist must be wary of combining negative effects, which may spoil a potion if not filtered out with a quality alembic.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs you experiment, you may notice a difference in weight between one potion and another. Potion weight is determined by the mean weight of ingredients mixed. To obtain lighter potions, when only two heavy ingredients of the right combination are available, you can mix in lighter, neutral ingredients to reduce the potion's weight. Adding a cheaper, more available ingredient such as saltrice can lighten your potions, unless of course it happens to add a negative effect to the potion you're trying to make.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYou may find through your experiments that using the lightest ingredients possible will sometimes net you zero weight. This factor seems to be entirely up to chance. Believe me, I've tried fortifying my luck in the hopes of making this happen, and it doesn't always work. Still, it is quite the happy accident when it does happen.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBasic Potions<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Health</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMany readily available ingredients can be combined to make this essential potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow<BR>\r\nWickwheat<BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nResin<BR>\r\nEmerald<BR>\r\nCorprus Weepings<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nSaltrice, marshmarrow, wickwheat, and corkbulb root are lightweight and inexpensive, so they are the best choices. Resin, emeralds and corprus weepings produce the same effect, but are rarer and more expensive, so they are better saved for other potions. Beware of mixing marshmarrow and corprus weepings, since it will spoil the potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Fatigue</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is the easiest potion to make, as numerous ingredients produce this effect:</BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\nHackle-Lo Leaf<BR>\r\nChokeweed<BR>\r\nScrib Jerky<BR>\r\nScuttle<BR>\r\nBread<BR>\r\nSmall and Large Kwama Eggs<BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThe best, most lightweight ingredients are saltrice, hackle-lo leaf, chokeweed, scrib jerky, and scuttle. Heavier ingredients include bread, kwama eggs (small and large), crab meat, and hound meat. All these ingredients are readily available. Beware of bad combinations, as mixing large kwama eggs with hackle-lo leaf will create an unwanted paralyze effect and spoil your potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeavier ingredients may not be the best, but though you may not want to lug these around, they are great fodder for practice potions. Both bread and small kwama eggs have no other effect, so it is the best way to use them up and gain skill. You can also make easy coin selling them to vendors.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Magicka</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe ingredients for this potion are a more difficult to obtain, with the exception of comberry, but it is certainly worth the trouble. The ingredients that will produce this effect are:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\nDeadra's Heart<BR>\r\nFrost Salts<BR>\r\nVoid Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThis potion is perhaps best left until you have some experience, as most ingredients are expensive and difficult to obtain. Comberry, found throughout the Ascasdian Isles, is common and inexpensive. All other ingredients -- deadra's heart, frost salts, and void salts -- are more difficult to come by, and dangerous to hunt for. Nevertheless, this potion is one of the most useful you can make if you happen to use magic.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAny potion you make, even at a beginner's level, will be worth more than the ingredients themselves, so long as you choose them wisely. A shrewd alchemist has the potential to make quite a lot of money. There are many ingredients ripe and ready for the picking throughout Vvardenfell, and each potion you make will get you a little further, and a little richer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese basic potions will get you through your early experiments with alchemy. As you gain skill, you will learn more effects for the ingredients you have. With experimentation and experience, soon you'll be making potions to match the master alchemists themselves.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Two: Potions of Curing<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCure potions have no duration, only magnitude. They work instantly, are 100% effective, and are often more cost effective than similar spells. This first volume lists the five cure potions that can be created by the home alchemist.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Blight Disease</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is possibly the most important potion in Vvardenfell, as the blight has touched even the remotest corners of the land. A cure blight potion is a must for any adventurer, and costs far less than a spell of similar effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo cure blight, mix any two of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Salts<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAsh salts and scrib jelly are common ingredients, reasonably priced at most alchemists. Ash salts can also be obtained from ash ghouls, though it is not recommended you go hunting Red Mountain for them. Scrib jelly comes from scribs, a passive animal that is easy to kill. However, watch out for the blighted ones, or you may need this potion sooner than you think.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Common Disease</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother useful potion that can be made by mixing any two of the following ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nChokeweed<BR>\r\nGravedust<BR>\r\nGreen Lichen<BR>\r\nMuck<BR>\r\nRed Lichen<BR>\r\nWillow Anther<BR>\r\nDaedra Skin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt it not recommended to mix muck with either gravedust or willow anther, since it will spoil the potion. Gravedust does not go well with red lichen either.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAll ingredients listed are lightweight and fairly easy to obtain, with the exception of daedra skin, which is expensive and only available at fine alchemists.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Paralyzation</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is not only useful for adventuring, but can also counter potions that have an unwanted paralyze effect. Four common ingredients can be used to cure paralyzation:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\nScamp Skin<BR>\r\nWillow Anther<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt is not recommended to mix netch leather with willow anther, as it will produce a negative effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorkbulb root and willow anther grows in the Ascadian Isles region. You'll have to hunt netches or scamps to get their hides, which is not recommended for the novice adventurer. These ingredients are inexpensive and available in most alchemy shops.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Cure Poison</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is essential if you happen to be hunting bull netches for their leather. Many ingredients produce this effect, so it can be made by mixing the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Lichen<BR>\r\nGhoul Heart<BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\nRat Meat<BR>\r\nRaw Ebony<BR>\r\nRoobrush<BR>\r\nScathecraw<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt is not recommended to mix scathecraw with either roobrush or black lichen. However, mixing scathecraw with scrib jelly or meteor slime will also produce a potion to restore willpower. Rat meat and ghoul heart have an added paralysis effect, so mixing them is not recommended unless you have a good quality alembic to filter out the effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt is important to keep track of the weight of your ingredients when making potions. For example, rat meat and raw ebony are heavy ingredients, so mixing these will produce a heavier potion that will encumber a traveler.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMost ingredients listed are fairly easy to obtain, with the exception of meteor slime, which is difficult to find. (Just a hint -- the bookseller Jobasha might know, but don't bother asking him about it.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Three: Potions of Restoration<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis part deals with potions of attribute restoration; potions of restore fatigue, health, and magicka are found in this author's previous work Alchemy for Beginners. Unfortunately, these homemade potions have a duration, which is unwanted in this case. When suffering a curse, it is better to buy potions of similar effect that have no duration to cure what ails you for good.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Agility</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnly two available ingredients can create this potion:<BR><BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBonemeal<BR>\r\nSload Soap<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nBoth these ingredients are fairly common. However, sload soap is relatively expensive because it is imported from the Black Marsh. It can be found at most fine alchemists. Bonemeal is found at grave sites on skeletons, undead or otherwise.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Endurance</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTwo simple ingredients can be combined to make this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nGravedust<BR>\r\nScales<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nGravedust can be found in most fine alchemists. Scales are found on slaughterfish, large or small. They are not difficult to find; just walk into the water, anywhere near Vvardenfell. Trust me, they will come.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Intelligence</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made by combining any two of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBittergreen Petals (treated or otherwise)<BR>\r\nRuby<BR>\r\nScrap Metal<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThis potion is somewhat frustrating to make as the ingredients, aside from bittergreen petals, are difficult to obtain. Scrap metal can be found plundering Dwemer ruins, but it is incredibly heavy, so lugging it out of these dangerous fortresses is almost as difficult as dissasembling Dwemer centurions. Due to its weight, it makes heavy potions, which is not ideal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCombining rubies and scrap metal will also create a negative effect, so it is not recommended. The best combination is rubies and bittergreen petals. Though rubies are expensive, they are lightweight and easier to obtain than scrap metal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Luck</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThree readily available ingredients can be used to produce this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nHack-Lo Leaf<BR>\r\nKresh Fiber<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining crab meat and hack-lo leaf will also restore fatigue, though the potion will be heavier than combining hackle-lo leaf and kresh fiber.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Personality</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo create this potion, any two of the following ingredients are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\nHeather<BR>\r\nScamp Skin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from any of these combined, but guar hide will leave you with a heavier potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Strength</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough this potion uses fairly common ingredients, you must beware when mixing them:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDreugh Wax<BR>\r\nGold Kanet<BR>\r\nRoland's Tear<BR>\r\nScamp Skin<BR>\r\nStoneflower Petals<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nMixing either gold kanet, roland's tear (a type of gold kanet), dreugh wax, or stoneflower petals will result in a drain luck effect. These ingredients should be combined with scamp skin instead, whenever possible.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Speed</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can only be made with the following two ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nResin<BR>\r\nRaw Ebony<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nIt is unfortunate that raw ebony is both expensive and heavy. Resin can be bought from a few select alchemists and vendors, so it is not common either.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Restore Willpower</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made by combining:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\nScathecraw<BR>\r\nTrama Root<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining scathecraw with scrib jelly or meteor slime will also cure poison. Combining meteor slime with scrib jelly will cure poison and fortify willpower as well. However, meteor slime is a rare ingredient.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Four: Potions of Fortifcation<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis part is divided into two sections: the first for attribute fortification potions, and the second for other fortification effects.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: Attribute Fortification<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Agility</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGreat for marksmen, or just about anyone, the following can be combined to produce this effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nEctoplasm<BR>\r\nFire Salts<BR>\r\nRoobrush<BR>\r\nSload Soap<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThese ingredients are fairly common, though you'll have to hunt flame atronachs for fire salts, and undead spirits for ectoplasm, if you don't wish to buy them. Combining the former two ingredients or roobrush is not recommended, because it will poison the potion. These three ingredients must be combined with sload soap instead. Combining sload soap with fire falts will also create a potion of fire shield.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Endurance</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion works well in combination with fortify speed. Three possible ingredients can be combined to make this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDaedra's Heart<BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAll three ingredients will produce a heavy potion, so mixing them with some lighter, neutral ingredients is recommended if you intend to use potion for traveling.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Intelligence</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis useful potion is a must for alchemists and enchanters alike. It can be made by combining any two of the following readily available ingredients:\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nNetch Leather<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAsh yams are abundant in Vvardenfell, so it is perhaps best combined with the other ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Luck</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis, like the previous recipe, will help enhance your alchemy or enchanting abilities. It can be made using the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nCorprus Weepings<BR>\r\nGuar Hide<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCorkbulb root and guar hide are common ingredients, therefore the easiest combination for this recipe. Combining guar hide with corprus weepings will spoil the potion. However, combining corprus weepings with corkbulb root will also create a potion of restore health.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Personality</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA must when bargaining for more expensive alchemy ingredients. To create this potion, any two of the following are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nGreen Lichen<BR>\r\nKresh Fiber<BR>\r\nStoneflower Petals<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients, and all are easy to obtain.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Strength</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be created with the following ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nDaedra Skin<BR>\r\nDreugh Wax<BR>\r\nVampire Dust<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients. Ash yams and dreugh wax are the more abundant of the four, therefore the most likely choice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Speed</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGreat for traveling on foot, or getting out of a fight, this potion can be made with the following three ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nKagouti Hide<BR>\r\nMoon Sugar<BR>\r\nShalk Resin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nBe aware that combining kagouti hide with shalk resin will spoil the potion. Unfortunately, moon sugar trade is illegal in Morrowind, so it may be difficult to obtain.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Willpower</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made using any two of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nMeteor Slime<BR>\r\nScrib Jelly<BR>\r\nWickwheat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining meteor slime with scrib jelly will cure poison and fortify willpower as well.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: Other Fortification Recipes\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Fatigue</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis not only fortifies, but restores as well. This wonderful dual purpose potion can be made by combining:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\nScrib Jerky<BR>\r\nScuttle<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nScrib jerky and scuttle produce a much lighter potion than combining either with hound meat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Health</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is incredibly handy, but unfortunately doesn't have the best combinations of ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHuman Flesh<BR>\r\nLarge Kwama Egg<BR>\r\nShalk Resin<BR>\r\nVampire Dust<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nNever combine shalk resin with human flesh. Scuttle and vampire dust is the optimal combination, but is expensive. The easiest combination is shalk resin with a large kwama egg. This creates a heavy potion, but the weight can be leveled out by adding lighter, neutral ingredients. Depending on which neutral ingredients you choose, this can also produce extra effects.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCombining a large kwama egg with a light restore health ingredient such as saltrice, marshmarrow, or wickwheat will create a potion that restores health at the same time. The more light ingredients you add to the potion, the lighter your potion will be, so what the heck, add two.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fortify Magicka</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made by combining two of these three ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nEmerald<BR>\r\nSaltrice<BR>\r\nStoneflower Petals<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining emeralds with saltrice will have the added benefit of restoring heath.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Five: Potions of Resistance and Shielding<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: Recipes of Resistance Potions<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Common Disease</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following can be combined to produce this effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nKagouti Hide<BR>\r\nPearl<BR>\r\nResin<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these four ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Poison</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother great potion for bull netch hunting. Three possible ingredients can be combined to make this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAlit Hide<BR>\r\nKwama Cuttle<BR>\r\nRat Meat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAny of these three ingredients will produce a heavy potion, so mixing them with lighter, neutral ingredients is recommended if you intend to use this potion for traveling. Combining rat meat with kwama cuttle, and a lighter cure poison ingredient such as scrib jelly will not only lighten your potion, but create a potion that cures poison as well. The key is to use rat meat, which produces both effects. Kwama cuttle was chosen because it is lighter than alit hide.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Fire</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion can be made using the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Anther<BR>\r\nFire Petal<BR>\r\nFrost Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Frost</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnly two ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Lichen<BR>\r\nFire Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Resist Shock</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is another wonderful dual purpose potion, creating a lightning shield as well. To mix this potion, the two following ingredients are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nScrap Metal<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThis potion is incredibly heavy, so you may want to add lighter, neutral ingredients to it. Adding an ingredient such as saltrice will also add the benefit of restore fatigue. Combine that with marshmarrow or wickwheat, and you have an even lighter potion that restores health as well, for little added cost. Get creative!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: Recipes of Shield Potions<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Fire Shield</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following will produce the desired effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\nFire Salts<BR>\r\nRaw Glass<BR>\r\nSload Soap<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nCombining fire salts and sload soap will also create a potion of fortify agility. Raw glass is heavy, and fire shield is the only positive effect you can create with it. It is also expensive, so it is better bartered for more useful ingredients than used in home alchemy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Frost Shield</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following will produce the desired effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nFrost Salts<BR>\r\nLarge Kwama Egg<BR>\r\nRaw Ebony<BR>\r\nWillow Anther<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects by combining any of these ingredients. However, both kwama eggs and raw ebony are heavy, therefore not the best combination.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Lightning Shield</FONT><BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nThe following ingredients produce the desired effect:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorkbulb Root<BR>\r\nCrab Meat<BR>\r\nScrap Metal<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAside from crab meat and scrap metal, which is also used in the shock resistance potion mentioned in the first section, corkbulb root can also be used to create a plain lightning shield potion without the added effect. It produces a lighter potion if scrap metal is not used.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPart Six: Potions of Magical Effect<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis part comprises of three sections: the first deals with potions of alteration, the second on potions of illusion, and the third on potions of mysticism. This compendium only deals with potions of positive effect, but harmful potions can also be made within the same schools of magic, such as burden or paralyze.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection One: Potions of Alteration<BR><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Feather</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFeather will make your burdens lighter, and your ruin raiding much brighter. The following three ingredients can be combined to produce this effect:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHeather<BR>\r\nRuby<BR>\r\nScuttle<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from combining any of these ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Levitate</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion is a must for any Telvanni sorcerer, and can be made with any of the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nCoda Flower<BR>\r\nRacer Plumes<BR>\r\nTrama Root<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nAny combination of these ingredients will result in excellent potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Swift Swim</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA most excellent potion for pearl diving, it can be made using the following:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDaedra Skin<BR>\r\nScales<BR>\r\nScrib Jerky<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nScales and scrib jerky are the most common combination because they are more readily available ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Water Breathing</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother must for you pearl divers out there. Four possible ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHackle-Lo Leaf<BR>\r\nKwama Cuttle<BR>\r\nLuminous Russula<BR>\r\nPearl<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nLuminous russula and kwama cuttle are not a good combination and will spoil your potion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Water Walking</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion will save your life when the slaughterfish become too much for you. To create this potion, two of the four following ingredients are needed:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAmpoule Pod<BR>\r\nKwama Cuttle<BR>\r\nScales<BR>\r\nViolet Coprinus<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nKwama cuttle will create a spoiled potion with violet coprinus, as it does with luminous russula.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Two: Potions of Illusion<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Invisibility</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is not the best potion for thievery, as some have suggested, but for casual sneaking it will do. Only two possible ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBittergreen Petals (also treated Bittergreen Petals)<BR>\r\nDiamond<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Light</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion's effect is different from the spell; because it only works on the imbiber, it is similar to night eye. Only two ingredients can create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBlack Anther<BR>\r\nRed Lichen<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Night Eye</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor seeing in the dark, of course. The two ingredients that can create this potion are:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nDaedra's Heart<BR>\r\nKagouti Hide<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nSeeing as daedra's heart is difficult to obtain, a potion of light may be a better choice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSection Three: Potions of Mysticism\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Detect Animal</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf you don't have a potion of night eye (or light) on you, this potion will help you avoid stepping on rats as you explore dark caves. You may use a combination of four possible ingredients to create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAlit Hide<BR>\r\nAmpoule Pod<BR>\r\nBloat<BR>\r\nEctoplasm<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no negative effects from any combination of these ingredients.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Detect Enchantment</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion brightens the glow of any enchanted items within range of the potions effect. Three possible ingredients can be used to create this potion.<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\nHypha Facia<BR>\r\nMarshmarrow<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nMixing hypha facia with marshmarrow is not recommended, as it will spoil the potion. Adding a dash of scuttle will lighten this potion, and add both the restore and fortify fatigue effects. You can also add saltrice or wickwheat to add restore health to your potion too.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Detect Key</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis fairly useful potion is similar to detect enchantment and has four possible ingredients:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nAsh Yam<BR>\r\nDiamond<BR>\r\nMuck<BR>\r\nSpore Pod<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no harmful combinations of ingredients for this potion. Muck and spore pods will create the lightest potions, and both ingredients are common.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Dispel</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis potion has no duration, only magnitude, much like cure potions. There are three possible ingredients you can use to create this potion:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nBungler's Bane<BR>\r\nMoonsugar<BR>\r\nPearl<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nBungler's bane and moonsugar are a bad combination for this potion, as it will also drain your endurance.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Reflect</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is an excellent potion for reflecting spells. Made by a more experienced alchemist, it is often more effective than similar spells or enchantments. Three ingredients can be used:<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nComberry<BR>\r\nDiamond<BR>\r\nHound Meat<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThere are no bad combinations of ingredients for this potion. Hound meat will result in a heavier potion, but it is more cost effective than using diamonds.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">Spell Absorbtion</FONT><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA favorite for mages, and often preferred over reflect. This potion can be created using three ingredients.<BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"0000FF\"><BR>\r\nFire Petal<BR>\r\nVampire Dust<BR>\r\nVoid Salts<BR>\r\n</FONT><BR>\r\nThese ingredients are more difficult to obtain than those for a reflect potion, but it is certainly worth it. Beware of mixing fire petals with void salts, which will produce an unwanted paralyze effect. If you find vampire dust difficult to obtain, you can instead mix in two more ingredients, such as willow anther and corkbulb root to create a cure paralyzation effect to counter paralyze within the same potion. Barring that, an alembic is your friend.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes the Alchemists Compendium. There are of course, more interesting combinations out there, and a whole lot of damaging ones. Experimentation is key, and, as always, happy mixing dear alchemists!<BR>"

It can be reached by port from Khull. This land has a cold climate, hostile to most plant life. The plants in this area are hardy, thriving in Solstheim's snowy mountainous regions and lush evergreen forests. If one is willing to brave the dangers and harsh climes of this land, it is worth taking note of the following plants useful to alchemists.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBelladonna<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBelladonna, also known as deadly nightshade, is a small perennial shrub that bears small round fruit. Green in their unripened state, they eventually turn a deep black. This fruit is surrounded by broad, pointed petals of a dusky violet coloration. The leaf is broad, oily, and flat, and can cause a severe rash if bare skin comes in contact with it. This plant sometimes appears brown and withered when covered by the year's frosts, but don't let that fool you. This plant is a survivor, and can remain dormant for many years. It does however have a low tolerance for sunlight, and does not cultivate well. It can grow almost anywhere in the wild, provided there is enough shade, from the cold rocky areas of Solstheim to the lush evergreen forests. The fruit can be picked in either its ripened or unripened state, and carries the same alchemical properties, all of which have effects on magicka.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResist Magicka<BR>\r\nRestore Magicka<BR>\r\nFortify Magicka<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHolly<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe holly bush sports sharp pleated leaves of a shiny dark green coloration, and grows bright red berries. It is most often found in the forested areas of Solstheim, but can also be spotted along snowy plains. The form of holly found on this island are typically evergreen. The berries tend to bloom in the late fall and early winter, and are hard and inedible. These berries eventually soften over the winter through repeated frosting and thawing. Holly has spritual significance to the native Skall, and is often used by shaman to treat frostbite. Holly berries have alchemical properties related to their environment. In other words, they are useful for frost resistances and related effects.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResist Frost<BR>\r\nFrost Shield<BR>\r\nFrost Damage<BR>\r\nWeakness to Fire<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWolfsbane<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWolfsbane is a species of aconitum flower. This herbal plant is rare, and has not been spotted by local herbalists in years. Dried varieties were on-hand for this author to sample however, and its alchemical uses have been well documented. This plant can be recognized by its flower with light purple veined petals, which are large and form a hood shape. The leaves are palmate and lobed with 5-7 segments, which are coarse and sharply pointed. Wolfsbane is a herb with much folklore attached to it, with particular attention to the lore of the werewolf. It is unclear whether this herb is supposed to cure or cause lycanthropy, as the tales vary from region to region, but this is not one of its official alchemical properties. Wolfsbane petals have a few useful alchemical effects. The most notable is invisibility, which could reduce the alchemist's need for diamonds, were the plant not so rare.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRestore Intelligence<BR>\r\nInvisibility<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt would be interesting to compare Solstheim's local flora with the plant life native to Skyrim. However, that will have to wait until another time. Until then, dear reader, adieu.<BR>"

It takes a skilled, strong hunter to take one of these critters down, and I aim to tell you how. Keep your eye out while traveling through the wild country. You'll come out the better for it if you don't let yourself get mobbed by a pack of beasties. A good bow and hefty axe are your best friends when traveling through this land. The snows are thick, so creatures are easy to track, or even avoid if need be. Most of these beasts are large and easy to spot, so make sure you spot them first. Remember to always shoot first, and you'll be on the better end of a fight.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI've been told that this book will sell better if I talk about alchemy, so I'll make sure to mention whatever alchemical whatsits these critter's hides have. Old Halgrin here never found much use for potion mixing, but a couple of potions have saved his hide, and I just happen to be pretty educated so here goes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBears<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe grizzly bear is big, furry, and ferocious. It can tear even the hardiest hunter to pieces if he's not careful. This critter has a nasty temper, but a few good arrows and a hefty axe can make short of one in no time. Just make sure to watch out for them claws. Bears are big, lumbering lugs, so chances are if you're a good marksman, you can take one of these critters down before their claws get you. Bears will avoid a camp if there's too many folks around, but they have no problem picking off stragglers. Bears can be found roaming about, but mostly sleep in dens. A good hunting party can come back with enough pelts for the winter by raiding one of these.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe plague bear is the nastiest of the bunch. Most hunters will avoid them rather than risk catching ataxia from one of these critters. They're stronger than the average bear too. The plague bear has a lighter coat than the grizzly, so you'd better be able to tell the difference. Ataxia's a nasty one. It'll drain your strength and make you weak and whiny. It hurts like a bugger too.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe snow bear is prized for its fluffy white coat. It's the strongest bear I know of, and will throw a couple nasty frost spells your way, so look out. Experienced hunters use fire enchanted arrows to take these beasties down, and a good frost resistance enchant will do you well too. Their pelts are thicker than the average bear's, and will keep you warm on even the coldest nights.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBear Pelts:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe pelts of bears are more useful to the hunter for making warm clothes to go bear hunting with, but it's got a few alchemical whatsits too:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nFortify Strength<BR>\r\nResist Common Disease<BR>\r\nNight Eye<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe snow bear's alchemy whatsits are pretty much the same excepting it fortifies speed instead of strength, so make sure you know how to tell the difference if you're doing any mixing. It's easy, really -- snow bear pelts are the white ones. A good night eye potion will make you a better hunter, so make sure you take one of these pelts to a good alchemist and get some. Resist common disease will also help you out if you happen to run into any plague bears.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTusked Bristleback<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese nasty piggies have grey pelts, with a stripe that runs down their fat white backsides. They've got a pair of tusks that'll gore you good if you're not careful. They don't have a lot of speed behind their charge, but they've got a lot of power. They're actually tougher than bears, and got nastier tempers to boot. You can use that power to your advantage easily. Just stick a spear in the ground and let the boar charge himself right onto it. Chances are it won't be able to turn before it spits itself. The rieklings keep them as pets, and don't take too kindly to hunters picking them off. The less the better, I say, and they're good eating too.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBristleback leather makes good boots for the ladies, and it's got a few alchemical whatsits as well.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBlind<BR>\r\nFrost Damage<BR>\r\nResist Frost<BR>\r\nRecall<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHorker<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe horker is a big blubbery critter that lives in the water. It's got little flippers, and tusks coming out of its big ugly maw. When hunting the horker, just remember that they know the water better than you. You'll need a good spear to hunt these critters. They don't see too well, but they've got keen hearing, so try not to splash about if you're swimming in their territory. It's better to harpoon them from a boat. They come up to surface every once in a while and spray all over the place. The coastal hunters know all the good places to go looking for them, so if you're after a big catch, it's best to go on an expedition with a local group.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHorker blubber is used in local tallow, and a single horker can supply a small village for a whole month -- but don't tell that to a Skaal. They get pretty mad if you make noise about killing horkers. They revere those honking blubber bags for some reason. Couldn't tell you why. I'm a more of a Thirsk nord myself. Horker blubber doesn't have many alchemical whatsits though, so I'll get to the point. What you want are the tusks. The locals don't have much use for these except to make fishing hooks and the like, so you can probably pick them up cheap from the local hunters. Their tusks have these alchemical whatsits apparently:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Alteration Skill<BR>\r\nFortify Intelligence<BR>\r\nFortify Maximum Magicka<BR>\r\nDetect Animal<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWolf<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere's many types of wolves out there, and none of them care for humans too much -- well, except for the Skaal, but even they need powerful shamans to control them. The wolves of Solstheim hunt in packs, and they're not afraid to pounce on a well armed hunting party in the middle of the night. The most common type of wolf is the grey wolf. It's relatively weak but relies on numbers, so hunters should still be careful about stumbling into their territory. They have good night vision, so that's when they prefer to hunt. These critters take every advantage they can.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe plague wolf has a red pelt and carries yellow tick disease. Yellow tick will make you weak and stiff, and causes painful bruising, so be careful of these critters. It's best to shoot them from afar if you ever run afoul of them. I dare say even the Skaal won't mind you thinning their numbers. They're nothing but mangy pests.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe snow wolf is light grey with white patches and legs. It can freeze a hunter solid with its bite. Like the snow bear, a good set of enchanted fire arrows will take care of this beasty. They are rare and revered around Solstheim, so don't shoot one anywhere near Skaal village, or they'll tan YOUR hide.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe pelt of the wolf makes for good fancy outing wear and is reasonably warm for hunting too, though not as warm or sturdy as bear hides. Snow wolf pelts are real prized, especially by Skaal shamans. Wolf pelts have got a few alchemical whatsits too, which I'll list for all you alchemy buffs out there. They're pretty much the same as white bear hides actually.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDrain Fatigue<BR>\r\nFortify Speed<BR>\r\nResist Common Disease<BR>\r\nNight Eye<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNasty Beasties to Avoid in Solstheim<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere's a few beasties out there that are not good hunting, but will certainly hunt you if you're ducking into caves or traveling through the wilds of Solstheim, so I figured it best to warn you about them. Some of them have got alchemical whatsits as well, so they might be good hunting if you're into that kind of thing.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDraugr<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe draugr are nasty fellows with black skin and red eyes. They were once strong and proud nord warriors, but don't let that stop you from killing them when you see them. They're cursed, undead critters, and like the taste of human flesh. They tend to hide in caves, and like to sneak up on people in the dark. They also like the cold, so don't try hitting them with frost enchantments and whatnot. Shock, paralysis, and poison don't effect them either. They snort kind of like pigs when they attack, and like to use their claws. Though they look like men, they're not very smart or fast, but they are strong and have a nasty grapple.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese nasties ooze a sticky black blood which is called gravetar. If you dare touching the stuff, it apparently has some alchemical whatsits you can use. It stinks like Dagoth's bum, but if you rub it into your clothes it'll protect you from the cold.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResist Frost<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nFortify Fatigue<BR>\r\nDrain Luck<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGrahl<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGrahl are rare beasties, and like to hide in caves, but if you ever run afoul of one, you'd better be prepared. These things have foot long claws and foot long tusks, which'll rip right through the toughest armor. No one's really sure what they are or where they came from. They're grey and spiky all over, and they're bloody huge! The \"fearsome grahl\" are actually not as tough as they look. Compared to most of the beasties in Solstheim, they're actually pretty weak. A good strong axe'll take care of them in short order. Watch out for the deadly grahl however -- they're immune to frost, shock, poison, and paralysis. They're also a lot stronger than their cousins. They'll attack you alone or in packs, the circumstances don't really matter to them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe grahl's eyeballs apparently have alchemical whatsits, and they're tusks make good trophies. If you're willing to put one of those eyeballs in your mouth it'll protect you from the frosts. I'm not suggesting it. I'm just saying is all.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResist Frost<BR>\r\nNight Eye<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nFortify Strength<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRiekling<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRieklings are nasty squat little ice goblins with bad tempers and blue skin. They're not very tough, but some of them ride boars and can run you right down. They're not as dumb as they look either. They're cunning little buggers, and will help each other out in a fight. They've got no alchemical whatsits on them, but it's good to know about them if you're traveling far north.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSpriggan<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese forest girlies don't like outsiders very much. They look kind of like ladies wearing tree trunks as corsets and have greenish skin. They've got a nasty set of claws and they're a lot stronger than they look, so look out. They're even more dangerous after you've killed them a couple times. Damned things keep coming back to life, and every time they do, they get stronger. I wouldn't suggest one for a date, that's for sure. They've got no alchemical whatsits either, but they sometimes carry plants on them if that's what you're into.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWerewolf<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNow we come to the nastiest nasty of the bunch -- the werewolf. They were all human once, and still are for most of the day, but if you ever run into one, you'd better have a good bow. These beasts are the toughest fight you'll find in Solstheim, and they're not scared of anything. They're claws may be nasty, but even worse, getting bitten by one of these beasts will give you the curse, and no Hircine-fearing soul wants that to happen. Luckily it's curable, so long as you catch it in the first three days before the change happens. A good cure potion is what you would need in such a case. They've almost been hunted to extinction, but I ran across one way back when, and there's always a chance that they'll spring up again. People still don't believe me when I say I've killed one. People don't want to believe they exist anymore, but my grandpappy was a werewolf hunter way back when, and we all owe our survival to good folk like him. It was NOT a wolf I tell you, the damn things are unnatural and you can tell the bloody difference when you see one. They stand on their hind legs for one. You ever seen a grey wolf do that? No sir, it was a werewolf I tell you, and I was just lucky to be carrying silver. People around Solstheim still carry silver weapons, and for good reason. Make sure you've got a few silver arrows on you when you're hunting. You just never know.<BR>"

The true key to successful enchanting is a healthy dose of luck. Luck will affect your skills far more than most people realize.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen I was a young student of the art, I trained and studied until I felt I could learn no more. I was certainly the most knowlegable and skilled enchanter of all my master's students, yet I still met with constant failure when attempting higher enchantments.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI took my master's advice, and fortified my intelligence with potions. The trick, of course, is to make one at a time, drinking each one in turn. With each successive potion, the quality of your potions increase along with your intelligence, and soon you'll be making incredibly powerful potions. Your alchemy skills don't even have to be very high, which mine certainly weren't at the time.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotion after potion, I drank myself into a kind of enlightened insanity. The aurbis and all its secrets unfolded before me. I was finally ready to enchant. However, my ambition got the better of me, and I decided to attempt the most difficult enchantment I knew. Even with my intellect raised beyond mortal proportions, the enchantment still failed. Even with my greatly enhanced intelligence, I could not figure out why.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt was then I noticed, with grim envy, how a fellow student made it look so easy. He was quite lax in his studies compared to myself, and yet he still created one successful enchantment after another. It positively drove me mad! Well, I was not going to take that kind of insult lightly. I raged at how such a fool could be a better enchanter than me when he had hardly cracked open a book. So, I decided to kill him.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOne night I crept into his room, planning to swap one of his potions for a deadly poison. As I examined his selection of potions, I noticed the one quality he had, in liquid abundance, was luck. The realization struck me: he didn't need to have much skill, or even smarts, if he was the luckiest bastard who ever lived. As lucky as he was, he still wasn't smart enough to realize he'd been poisoned before he keeled over dead at my feet, but after I satisfied my lust for revenge, I decided to try his little trick myself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFrom then on, I always made sure to have a few spare fortify luck potions on hand when attempting more difficult enchantments, and this method has never failed me.<BR></FONT>"

      "mesh": "OAAB\\m\\Text_BoV_Dae.nif",
      "icon": "OAAB\\m\\Tx_bov_Dae.dds",
      "text": "<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\r\nThe Book of Lesser Daedra<BR>\r\nA treatise by Omavyl Rhea of the Tribunal Temple<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR><BR>\r\nThere has been much written on the Daedric Princes and their involvement in mortal affairs, as well as much discussion on their nature and the nature of Oblivion. However, little has been written about their servants, the lesser daedra, though they are the daedra most encountered in our world. It also begets the question, why are they so often encountered? Why do they roam Nirn unbound in such numbers?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMost lesser daedra are encountered near ancient daedric shrines. This supports the most popular theory: they were once sent to serve worshipers of the Daedric Princes, and have since been left to run feral amongst the ruins. This is a comforting thought to the Tribunal Temple, the primary advocate of this theory, as it supposes the decline in daedric worship will herald a gradual decline in the populations of lesser daedra as they are sent back to Oblivion over time. The Temple Ordinators are often sent out to clear the ancient daedric ruins of their denizens in their efforts to purge them from our plane. However, this effort has proved futile as more and more daedra are found roaming the wilds each year.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGiven the fact that the Tribunal Temple has made efforts to clear daedric sites of worship, and that there has been an increase in daedric activity over the years rather than the expected decrease, another theory comes to light. This theory has dark connotations, which the Temple has refused to consider. The wild daedra must be evidence of a weakening in the division of planes. Even with daedric worship in decline, one or more of the Daedric Princes must be stirring. We are closer to Oblivion than we have been since the dark ages.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor this reason, I have proposed the Temple outlaw all forms of daedric summoning. Each daedra summoned, even if only for a few moments, serves to weaken the boundary between worlds. This proposal has fallen on deaf ears within the Temple, so I leave it up to the reader's conscience. However, there is something to be learned from the study of lesser daedra. The more they are encountered, the better prepared we are to defeat them. Thus, I write this treatise on their various aspects.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSome lesser daedra can be divided by the Daedric Princes they serve; however, individual daedroth will serve any Daedric Prince or mortal on a whim. Most common lesser daedra serve no one at all, running feral upon the land. I found it best to categorize them alphabetically instead, with brief mention of their common realms.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAtronachs:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe atronachs are powerful elemental beings, with fire atronachs and frost atronachs being the weaker, and storm atronachs being the stronger of the three. They each command their own element, and resist elemental damage of their given type. They also resist normal weapons and can reflect spells. Fire atronachs have a weakness to frost, and frost to fire; storm atronachs have no particular elemental weaknesses. Fire atronachs are most commonly found in Vvardenfell, as they tend to gravitate towards the fires deep below Red Mountain.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe three types of atronach provide salts which alchemists prize for their unique properties. Their properties are as follows:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFire Atronach - Fire Salts<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nFortify Agility<BR>\r\nResist Frost<BR>\r\nFire Shield<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFrost Atronach - Frost Salts<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nRestore Magicka<BR>\r\nFrost Shield<BR>\r\nResist Fire<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStorm Atronach - Void Salts<BR>\r\nRestore Magicka<BR>\r\nSpell Absorbtion<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nClannfear:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe clannfear is a lizard-like creature with no particular resistances or weaknesses. They are quite mundane compared to most daedra. Often mistaken as creatures of mundis, they do not seem out of place roaming Vvardenfell's landscape. They are slow, but strong in their attacks, and their bite can sever limbs.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe clannfear is notable for the fact that its heart is pure daedric in quality. It is prized by alchemists, and even eaten by mages for dinner for its restorative properties.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDaedra Heart:<BR>\r\nRestore Magicka<BR>\r\nFortify Endurance<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nNight Eye<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDaedroth:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe daedroth, like the clannfear, has a reptilian appearance, but is tougher and a great deal more intelligent. It wields magick, its primary attack being a poisonous cloud, and is also known to cast shock spells. Though quite a heavy hitter in melee combat, it only resorts to its claws in close range. Highly resistant to normal weapons, this creature should be approached with caution. Casting absorb magicka or reflect can make short work of a daedroth, but a warrior must close in quickly and dispatch the creature with a silver or enchanted weapon.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLike the clannfear, the daedroth's heart is the one part of the creature that has uses in alchemy. It's properties are the same as stated above in the clannfear entry.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDremora:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe dremora are powerful warriors in the service of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of destruction and change. They are highly intelligent and have been known to aid or even serve mortals if it serves their purpose, even if that purpose is mere whim or curiosity. They are rarely found outside daedric ruins, preferring their master's realm to our world. Most remaining on Nirn have either been summoned here, or await their master's orders before returning to Oblivion. Of course, they are more difficult to control, and take a great deal more effort and magicka to summon than more common daedra. The dremora also have a system of rank and title, the most powerful having the title of lord bestowed upon them by their master Mehrunes Dagon. Dremora typically engage in melee combat, wielding powerful daedric weapons. Dremora Lords also wield powerful fire spells, and are much fiercer than their lesser kind in combat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe dremora's heart is again the same as other daedroth listed above.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGolden Saint:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe golden saints are the beautiful, strange, and dangerous daughters of the mad god Sheogorath. They are fierce and powerful in combat, and have golden armored skin that is highly resistant to normal weapons and the elements. They carry powerful weapons and shields, and wield them both with expert skill. They can also dispel magick, much to the chagrin of enchanters trying to harvest their souls. The golden saint's soul is most prized by enchanters, being the most powerful found aside from the gods themselves.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe daedra's heart is again much like any other. The golden saint is, of course, more prized for her powerful soul.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHunger:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe hunger, considered the most hideous daedra, is the servant of Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of deceit. This creature attacks with teeth, tongue, and claws, and can paralyze its prey. Its touch also disintegrates armor and weapons. It is resistant to normal weapons, all forms of elemental damage, and poison. It is best to combat this creature at a distance, if circumstances permit.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDaedra's heart -- see entry Clannfear.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOgrim:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe orgim is a large blundering behemoth, servant of Lord Malacath, the keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse. Their large size and powerful melee attacks make it a formidable enemy, and its tough skin is resistant to normal weapons. It also heals quickly. Combatting an ogrim is an exercise in patience.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDaedra's heart.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScamp:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe scamp is a weak and cowardly creature. Said to be the servants of Mehrunes Dagon, in truth they will serve just about anything or anyone. They are the most easily summoned and controlled daedra, but can also be the most chaotic and pestilent, turning on their mortal masters if they loosen their control for a second. They are relatively intelligent, at least more so than their more bestial daedric cousins. Because they can follow simple commands and tasks, they are often employed by mages. Scamps are weak opponents, but they make up for their deficiencies in resistances. They are immune to normal weapons, highly resistant to poison, and resist all elemental damage.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe scamp's skin has many useful alchemical properties, but is not as rare or prized as the daedra heart, as the scamp is fairly common and easily hunted.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScamp's Skin<BR>\r\nDrain Magicka<BR>\r\nCure Paralyzation<BR>\r\nRestore Personality<BR>\r\nRestore Strength<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWinged Twilight:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe winged twilight is said to be the winged messenger of Azura, the Queen of the Night Sky. However, as kind and gentle as Azura has reputedly been to mortal kind, her so-called messengers are not. Winged twilights, when found on the mortal plane, attack any living thing in sight. Though they have wings, they prefer to remain on the ground, only momentarily hovering to attack with clawed feet. Unlike other daedra, they are not resistant to normal weapons, but have strong immunity to poison, and lesser immunities to the elements. The winged twilight also has a strong soul and, though not as prized as the soul of a golden saint, will do just as well for most enchanting purposes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Uses:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe winged twilight, like the storm atronach, is a source of void salts, the alchemical properties of which are found under the storm atronach entry.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWith this book, I hope to enlighten anyone with a mind to exterminating daedra, for whatever reason. Knowledge of their special resistances and weaknesses, and style of attack must bear to mind before initiating combat with these creatures. Whether they are hunted for alchemy or enchanting purposes, for their weapons, or because the warrior serves a righteous cause, does not matter. The fewer of these creatures that walk upon this world the better.<BR>"

At least three: one to requisition the paperwork; one to sign as a witness on the forms; and one to stand guard to make sure no-one's lighting illegal fires in the meantime.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nQ. How many Orcs does it take to light a fire?<BR>\r\nA. First you have to introduce them to fire.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nQ. Why do Dunmer live on Vvardenfell?<BR>\r\nA. They need something to complain about.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA Bosmer walks into a bar. A Dunmer says to him: \"This place is amazing. You can jump off the roof and float in the air.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Bosmer responds, \"That sounds great. Please show me how.\" And so the two make their way to the roof.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nUpon their arrival, the Dunmer jumps off and floats in the air.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Let me try,\" the Bosmer cries, and jumps off. He falls to the ground and dies.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA patron inside the bar remarks, \"Another idiot from Cyrodiil bites the dust. Do none of them know about levitation?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOne day, a Dunmer decided to complain to his local slaver:<BR>\r\n\"I bought an Argonian slave here last week, and he died the very next day.\"<BR>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" the slaver replied, \"I've had that slave in my pens for weeks and he never died once.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA Hlaalu woman was set to marry a rich noble, but was hesitant about the arrangement:<BR>\r\n\"Why do you not want to marry him?\" her father asked. \"He comes from a good family, and is incredibly rich.\"<BR>\r\n\"He is old,\" she replied, \"I would be more willing if he were older.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA Khajiit, a Dunmer, an Imperial, and a Bosmer were all on a ship.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Khajiit pulls a vial of skooma out of his jacket, drinks a little, then tosses the rest overboard and says, \"We have enough back home.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Dunmer takes a bundle of Hackle-lo, tastes a leaf, then tosses the rest overboard saying, \"We have enough back home.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Imperial looks around, sees the Bosmer, and then tosses him overboard.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDuring the war of Betony, a Sentinel outpost ran afoul of a mercenary company of Orcs. As the Sentinels lay in wait behind their fortifications, a solitary orc makes its way to the wall and yells, \"Come out here, ya yella bellied girlie boys, and I'll give ya what for.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Sentinel commander orders, \"I want 20 men to deal with that pathetic Orc.\" and sends twenty of his best men over the hill. Ten minutes later, at the crest of the hill, the Orc appears again. \"Ya Redguard panty wastes,\" he yells. \"Come on, the rest of ya!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Sentinel commander is somewhat annoyed. He sends 100 men this time to finish the job. Ten minutes later, the Orc appears once more, his hair all sticking up, his shirt a bit torn. \"Ya human SCUM,\" he yells. \"I'm just warming up. Come and get me, ya Redguard pansies.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe commander loses patience, and orders 500 men to take out the Orc. They pour out of the fortress en masse and ride across the field of battle. Ten minutes later, the Orc is back. His clothing is all torn and his face is covered in blood. \"Is that the best ye can do? You fight like wood elves. Come on,\" he yells.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe commander is nonplussed. \"Take 1000 men over that hill and don't come back till you've killed him,\" he commands. His second in command musters the men and they ride off over the hill to their fate. Ten minutes later, one of the troops appears back at the top of the hill. He's covered in blood and his clothes are all torn. \"Commander,\" he yells. \"It's a trap.<BR>\r\nThere's TWO of them!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA Khajiit, a Redguard, and an Altmer are sitting in a prison on Summerset Isle. Out of boredom, they began to discuss their circumstances.<BR>\r\nThe Altmer asks the Khajiit what his crime was.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I snuck into the house of a wizard and tried to make off with his potions and scrolls,\" the Khajiit answered. \"I needed to pay off my skooma dealer.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"And your sentence?\" The Redguard asked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"They will brand me with magicka-driven flames and exile me to Elsweyr. What are you in for?\" the Khajiit answered, saddened by what the High Elves intended to do to his beautiful fur.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I was overheard telling the tale of how I defeated an Altmer gladiator in the Arena in the Imperial City.\" the Redguard answered.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"What'll they do to you?\" The Altmer asked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Just deport me. And you?\" the Redguard answered.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I'm condemned to death.\" the Altmer said quietly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"By S'rendarr, what did you do?\" the Khajiit exclaimed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I said that all races are equal before the gods,\" the Altmer said.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTwo Khajiits and an Argonian were walking down a beach. The Argonian tripped over a bottle, and out popped Sheogorath.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"You have found me in a particularly good mood this day; And so I will grant you each one wish,\" proclaimed Sheogorath.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe first Khajiit thought for one moment, and then said, \"Oh great Skooma Cat, I wish for a mountain of moon sugar.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Granted,\" said Sheogorath, and the Khajiit had as much moon sugar as he could ever eat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe second Khajiit looked at the first Khajiit's mountain of moon sugar and exclaimed, \"Oh great Skooma Cat, please bless me with a giant lake filled with skooma.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Granted,\" said Sheogorath, and the second Khajiit had as much skooma as he could drink.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"And what do you wish for?\" Sheogorath asked the Argonian.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I wish the skooma lake and moon sugar mountain were both poisoned.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere once was a wealthy Altmer who kept a score of prized hounds. He was careful about their breeding, and so kept them locked in the stables.<BR>\r\nOne night a thief got into his stables and happened to let one of the Altmer's prized hounds out. A week later it returned pregnant. The wealthy Altmer was nonplussed, but could never be sure, so he decided to let nature take its course.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNearly two months later, someone broke into his stables again. This time it was a poor Breton couple, who could not find an open inn in time for his wife to give birth. The Breton wife delivered her child in the stables. They then heard footsteps approaching, and so they hid themselves in the hay.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe wealthy Altmer heard crying in his stable, and thus found the child squalling in the hay.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Another damned mutt,\" the Altmer sighed, and turned to his stable-hand. \"Take this abomination and throw it in the river.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOne day, Tiber Septim was walking down a crowded avenue when he chanced upon a man who looked strikingly similar to himself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTiber approached the man and asked, \"You look familiar. Are you related? Did your mother perchance work as a maid in the palace?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo which the peasant replied, \"No Your Majesty, but my father worked there as a gardener.\"<BR>"

It produces a substance called bloat, a white fleshy tuber that has valuable uses in alchemy. It grows in dark humid climates, found mainly in enclosed cave systems. It once thrived along the Bitter Coast, but has dwindled to a few select caves in Vvardenfell. The blight has nearly caused this spore's extinction across the province. Though variants exist in the Black Marsh, only through careful cultivation may the native Morrowind species be preserved.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCultivation:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDue to the blight, bloatspore must be sheltered from the elements. They thrive best in humid caves, in the presence of bioluminescent fungus. Cultivators use glowing magicka crystals to accelerate their growth. These crystals are imbued with power until they radiate a magicka field. The bloatspores absorb the magicka, causing accelerated growth and improved quality of the bloat it produces. The production of magicka crystals is a long held Telvanni secret. Bloatspores can be grown without these crystals; however, they will not grow as quickly or as large.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThreats to the Bloatspore:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe greatest threat to the bloatspore is blight disease. This disease, often carried by infected creatures, can devastate whole bloatspore populations. Due to an increase in infected creatures sheltering in caves from blight storms, the bloatspore has nearly become extinct throughout the province.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBloatspore is the shalk's primary food source. The bloatspore was not under threat until blight storms decreased the food supply and tipped the balance. There are no longer enough bloatspores in existence to supply the shalk population. Lacking an abundance of alternate food supplies, shalks will travel for miles to feast on the last remaining bloatspores in the region. Shalks will always find a way to get into caves, so bloat cultivators must be vigilant in keeping them away. However, shalks are not the only threat. Any blight infected creature can threaten the spores, so any creatures that crawl into bloat mine must be eradicated.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHarvesting:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHarvesting bloat is a delicate process. Extreme care must be taken not to harm the bloatspore while removing the white fleshy tuber from its center. Ages ago, before the bloatspore became endangered, muck shovels were used to extract the tuber from the spore. These days, such reckless methods are far too dangerous to the dwindling bloatspore population.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTodays methods involve carefully cutting the tuber away from the pod with a sharp knife. Care must be taken not to damage the pod, otherwise the spore will shrivel up and die. If its outer flesh is cut or damaged, a deep rot will quickly set in. If the cut is not too deep, a magical salve may be applied to the spore and eventually it will heal, but if the cut is too deep, there is no saving it. Even bruises can cause the spore to shrivel up and rot.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFound deep within the tuber is the bloatspore's seeds. The bloatspore produces the tuber to attract creatures, such as the shalk, to feast upon it. The bloatspore usually dies at this point, its seeds fertilized by its mother's decaying matter. Bloat cultivators remove the seeds after extracting the tuber, which can be planted in a compost of dung and decaying plant matter mixed with bloat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf the cultivator is careful, the bloatspore will live on to poduce more bloat and more seeds. It usually takes several months for the tuber to grow large enough to be harvested again. This time can be cut down to three months with the aid of magicka crystals.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe bloatspore can live like this for up to five years, at which point it stops producing bloat. The spore stops producing seeds in under two years if they are removed with each harvesting, but removing the seeds will, in the long run, produce more seeds than if they are left alone. After five years, the bloatspore will be nothing more than a toughened husk, which is broken down into compost to feed future generations of the spore.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Future of the Bloatspore:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWith careful cultivation and harvesting, the endangered bloatspore can be saved from extinction. Bloatspore seeds can remain dormant for hundreds of years. The spore, under the care of cultivators, produces far more seeds than can be sustained, which are collected and stored for future use.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nResearch is currently being done to cultivate a hardy breed of the bloatspore. Current attempts have not yet been succesful, but this line of research shows much promise. Perhaps a future breed may thrive across these blight ridden lands.<BR>\r\n<BR></FONT>"

Most common diseases are contracted through exposure to various beasts, or someone already infected. Diseased animals, alive or dead, can infect mer or man. Travelers are in particular danger, due to not developing local immunities, so one must make sure to take plenty cure disease potions on lengthy journeys.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nListed here are the sixteen types of common diseases found in Morrowind and the nearby isle of Solstheim, as well as the creatures that carry them. These diseases are divided into three kinds: mild, serious, and acute. Common diseases are not usually fatal, but it is important to cure them as soon as possible, for your sake and for those around you.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis book is divided into two sections. The first lists diseases contracted through animal contact in the wild. The second section deals with diseases commonly found in towns and villages, either contracted through human contact or farm animals.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCommon diseases in the wild:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAtaxia<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAtaxia is a mild common disease that affects the victim's strength and agility. Symptoms include generalized pain and muscle stiffness. It often infects alit and the plague bears of Solstheim.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAtaxia's symptoms can be temporarily alleviated by taking potions of restore strength and restore agility. Chewing on raw chokeweed will temporarily alleviate the pain, if a cure potion is not readily available, but this has the unwanted side-effect of draining the sufferer's luck.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBrown Rot<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBrown rot is a mild disease that reduces the victim's strength and affects behavior. Symptoms include necrosis and sleeplessness. It is usually contracted from contact with bonewalkers -- greater or lesser -- and sometimes, though rarely, through other forms of undead.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotions of restore strength and personality can be taken to alleviate some of the disease's symptoms. A poultice of gravedust and muck may be applied to combat necrosis until either a healer or a proper cure potion is found.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCollywobbles<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCollywobbles is a serious disease affecting the victim's strength, endurance, and mobility. Symptoms include uncontrollable shaking and chronic weariness. It is usually contracted from shalks.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotions of restore strength, endurance, and speed can be taken in lieu of a proper cure potion. This will also temporarily alleviate the sufferer's shaking.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDroops<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDroops is a serious disease that affects the victim's strength. Symptoms include weak and flaccid muscles. It may be contracted from all forms of kwama.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA strong potion of restore strength will temporarily aid the sufferer. However, long term exposure to this disease may cause permanent muscular damage. It is particularly acute in children, and may hinder their growth and development if not treated immediately.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHelljoint<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHelljoint is a mild common disease affecting the victim's mobility and dexterity. Symptoms include persistent irritation and inflammation of the joints. It is often contracted from cliff racers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotions of restore agility and speed may be taken until a cure potion is taken. To alleviate the irritation and inflammation, a poultice of red lichen and willow anther may be applied.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRotbone<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRotbone is a disease which causes mild fatigue in the victim. Symptoms include drowsiness and a dull ache in the joints. It is contracted from the durzogs of Mournhold.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChewing on saltrice is the common method of combating the symptoms of this disease. A good hot meal consisting of bread and kwama eggs is also recommended until it is cured.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSwamp Fever<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSwamp Fever is a mild disease commonly found along coastal regions. Symptoms include high body temperature and delirium. It is contracted through exposure to mudcrabs.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotions of restore strength and endurance can be taken if a cure potion is not handy. Muck is usually applied to the sufferer's skin to combat the fever.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWitbane<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWitbane is an acute common disease that affects memory, and victims will often seem disoriented. It is often contracted from the common rat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA potion of restore agility can be taken if a cure potion is not immediately on-hand. This is only a temporary measure however, and a proper cure should be administered as quickly as possible. Prolonged exposure to this disease may cause permanent memory loss.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYellow Tick<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYellow Tick is a mild disease affecting the victim's strength and mobility. Symptoms include dark, bruise-like swellings that are painful to the touch. It is often contracted from kagouti and the plague wolves of Solstheim.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotions of restore strength and speed can be taken until a proper cure is administered. A poultice of green lichen and muck should also be applied to hinder swelling.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCommunal Diseases:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following diseases are most often contracted through contact with either humans or farm animals, and not from the beasts they are often attributed to by local healers. The casual adventurer will not likely catch these diseases in the wild.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChills<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChills is an acute common disease that affects the victim's mind and coordination. Symptoms include clumsiness and mental confusion, as well as extreme fluctuations in body temperature. Locals believe chills comes from contact with the undead, but it is rarely contracted in this manner. It is more often spread from person to person. Scholars believe the myth comes from the sufferer's hallucinations, who often claim to have been visited by angry ghosts while in bed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotions of restore intelligence, agility, and willpower must be taken if a cure potion is not readily at hand. Due to the potent hallucinations, the sufferer should not be left alone until a cure is administered.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDampworm<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDampworm is another serious disease that affects the victim's mobility. Symptoms include uncontrollable muscle spasms and twitching. It is said to be contracted from nix-hounds, but this is yet unproven. This author has yet to treat a single case contracted in this manner. It is more often contracted by people living in unhygienic conditions. It is caused by a parasite that burrows under the skin and afflicts the muscle tissues and central nervous system.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA strong potion of restore speed can be taken to temporarily alleviate dampworm's symptoms. There is no way to control the spasms other than a proper potion of curing, so it should be treated immediately. In severe cases, a patient may require several treatments until all parasites are eliminated. Patients are also recommended to fumigate their homes by burning lichen (of any variety) for at least three days.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGreenspore<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGreenspore is a serious common disease that affects the victim's behavior. Symptoms include irritability, shortness of breath, and violent outbursts, and may also include mild dementia. It is said to be contracted from slaughterfish. It is more often caught in swamps and probably has more to do with the local plant life than the fauna. Its real cause is a fungal spore, sometimes found growing on slaughterfish, which lodges itself in the sufferer's lungs and begins to grow.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA potion of restore personality can be administered in lieu of a potion of curing, but will not aid the sufferer's dementia. Along with a potion of curing, patients are also recommended to inhale smoke from burning lichen several times a day, for about a week.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRattles<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRattles is a mild common disease that affects the victim's willpower and dexterity. Symptoms include muscle spasms and listlessness. It is said to be contracted from nix-hounds, but this is unfounded. In truth, this is disease only tends to affect children. Its true cause is unknown, though parents who suffered this affliction as a child will often find it affects their children as well.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn acute cases, a cure potion is administered to the infected child. This rarely helps however, and often the child is given either specially made potions of drain fatigue to calm them down, or made to chew a gum made from shalk resin which produces a similar effect. However, this disease is often mis-diagnosed, and usually just a good spanking is in order.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRockjoint<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRockjoint is an acute disease affecting the victim's manual dexterity. Symptoms include painful swelling and immobility in the joints. It may be contracted from the domesticated guar, but is more often caused by dirty or infected wounds. It is most commonly contracted by farmers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA potion of restore agility should be administered to the patient immediately if a cure potion is not readily available. Prolonged exposure to this disease can cause permanent deterioration of the joint tissues. A poultice of red lichen and willow anther can be administered to alleviate the victim's suffering.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRust Chancre<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRust Chancre is a mild common disease affecting the victim's mobility and behavior. Symptoms include swelling, rash, and painful muscle spasms. It may be contracted from the waste rat, not the common kind, and is rare. The disease is usually only found in Ashlander camps.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotions of restore personality and speed can be taken to combat some of this disease's effects. A poultice of muck and red lichen should also be administered to alleviate the victim's suffering until a proper cure can be obtained.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSerpignious Dementia<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis common disease is serious and affects the victim's mind and behavior. Symptoms include hallucinations, and an itchy, unsightly skin condition resembling snake scales. It may be contracted from netches, but is rare. Usually only contracted through prolonged contact with the beasts, it is most often found in netch herders.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotions of restore intelligence, willpower, and personality should be administered immediately if a cure potion is not handy. Rubbing muck on the skin will also alleviate the skin condition somewhat, and should be applied every day for a month even after a cure is administered.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWither<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWither is a mild common disease that affects a victim's strength and endurance. Symptoms include loss of energy and shortness of breath. Wither is common along the coasts, and said to be contracted from dreugh. This theory is unfounded however, and it is more often contracted from other people.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotions of restore strength and endurance are often taken in lieu of a cure potion. Sufferers can also chew on saltrice to alleviate the symptoms. This disease tends not to be taken seriously and is rarely properly treated in poorer communities, hence its tendency to spread rapidly through such areas.<BR>\r\n<BR>"

As such, blight is common in Ashlander communities. Many animals also roam this area, so it is common for hunters and travelers to contract blight from exposed animals. These diseases are severe and resist common cures. A special potion of cure blight must be administered to the sufferer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere are two kinds of blight disease: wasting diseases, which attack one or more of an organism's systems; and abnormal growth diseases, which distort the organism's functions and structures. There are four different blight diseases, each of which will be covered in this volume along with the creatures that typically carry them. Corprus is also mentioned, though there is currently no known cure.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh-Chancre<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh-chancre is an acute blight disease affecting the victim's behavior. It is usually contracted through exposure to blighted kwama, of any kind, or cliff racers. The sufferers of this disease usually show no outward physical symptoms, only distorted reasoning and a barely perceptible drop in body temperature.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh-chancre can be temporarily alleviated by taking a strong potion of restore personality. This will only mask the symptoms however, and prolonged exposure can permanently alter the victim's perceptions and cause chronic depression. It should be treated immediately upon diagnosis.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh Woe<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAsh woe is an acute blight disease affecting the victim's will and thought processes. It is most commonly contracted from ash ghouls, ash slaves, or blighted shalk. Acute symptoms include a greying of the skin, emaciation, and tumorous growths on the body.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStrong potions of restore willpower and restore intelligence can be taken to alleviate symptoms. However, if not properly treated, the victim will eventually show signs of permanent brain damage. Such victims will eventually suffer the unfortunate fate of becoming ash ghouls.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBlack-Heart<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBlack-heart is an acute blight disease affecting the victim's strength and endurance. It is often contracted from blighted alit, nix-hounds, or rats, and can also be contracted from lame corprus. The physical symptoms of black-heart include a wasting of muscular tissues and a gradual malformation of bones.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe symptoms of black-heart can be temporarily alleviated by taking potions of restore strength and endurance. However, the muscular tissue will continue to waste away, and any bone growth in young victims will be severely stunted and malformed if not treated immediately. In adults, the bones will gradually twist, causing permanent crippling through extended exposure.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChanthrax<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChanthrax is a rare acute blight affecting the victim's dexterity and mobility. It is only known to be contracted through exposure to blighted kagouti. Its outward symptoms are a severe swelling of the joints, acute pain, rashes, and fever.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChanthrax symptoms can be temporarily alleviated by taking potions of restore agility and speed. Prolonged exposure will result in permanent damage to the soft tissues of the body, and scaling of the skin. If not treated in time, the victim can also look forward to a severely reduced life expectancy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorprus<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorprus is a rare form of blight disease that cannot go unmentioned in this text. This deadly disease attacks the victim's mind and body. The victims grow insane and extremely violent, and their bodies sprout massive tumorous growths. It gradually deforms the whole body until the victim is nearly unrecognizable as human. The disease's progress varies from victim to victim. Another interesting fact is, in contracting corprus, one becomes immune to other forms of disease. It is always fatal, but its progress can be either rapid, or keep the victim in agony for years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt was this author's privilege to study the victims in Divayth Fyr's Corprusarium at one time, and I have come to a few conclusions. It is unproven that corprus can be spread through contact with a victim, and in fact, this author has never in his career seen it spread such a manner. Through prolonged contact, I would almost say it is completely safe to come into contact with corprus victims, except of course for their violent tendencies. The real cause of corprus is unknown, but there may be something to it being referred to as \"The Divine Disease.\" There is no real known cause. In fact, the fear of the spread of corprus through human contact may be pure fear-mongering. There is no doubt it is contracted somehow, and seemingly randomly, but it still requires further research to pinpoint its true source.<BR>"

It can be found by navigating the road northwest of Caldera.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Berandus:<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Northwest of Adasreth, near the West Gash coast, it is located southeast of Gnisis.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Falasmaryon:<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This stronghold lies deep in the northern Ashlands and south of Valenvaryon.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Falenarano:<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This stronghold is located on the southernmost tip of the Grazelands, near the border of Molag Amur.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Hlomaren:<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This stronghold lies west of Balmora, along the Bitter Coast.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Indoranyon:<BR>\r\nThis stronghold is located along Azura's coast and the eastern border of the Grazelands.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Marandus:<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Sitting on the shore of Lake Nabia, in Molag Amur, it can be accessed by waterway from Suran.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Rotheran:<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This stronghold is located in Sheogorad, on the southernmost tip of the isle of Dagon Fel.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Telasero:<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This stronghold lies on the southern coast of Molag Amur, between Suran and Molag Mar.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Valenvaryon:<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This stronghold is located in the Ashlands, on the northernmost edge of the coast.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Map of the Dunmer Strongholds and Propylon Routes:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\propylonmap.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTheories on Architecture, History, and Purpose of the Strongholds<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Dunmer have no records of stronghold construction, but the architectural style has similarities to the High Velothi period. The strongholds exist side-by-side with ancient Velothi towers, attributed to the Chimer during the High Velothi period. The Tribunal Temple still employs this architectural style to this day. The Dunmer strongholds however, show a marked divergence from High Velothi architecture. They are grander, starker, more geometric in design, and far more difficult to penetrate. Explorers who have survived probing their interiors have reported that they contain many levels, each one with grand hallways and hundreds of rooms. The top level is flat and perfectly positioned for archers. Its walls slope steeply and are well fortified with thousands of tons of perfectly cut stone. The entrance doors are heavy, and force intruders to navigate long passageways before entering the stronghold's larger interior domains.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe architectural style of the strongholds seems to betray a more military mindset compared to the lighter and brighter High Velothi period. If you look at the current inhabitants of these structures, you may note that typically lone wizards and magicians prefer to occupy Velothi towers; whereas people who occupy Dunmer strongholds band in groups, out of a need to defend themselves and remain hidden.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOf all the Great Houses of the Dunmer, only the Redoran have made attempts to reclaim the ancient strongholds. The Telvanni have been keen to adopt ancient Velothi towers as their homes, and the Hlaalu are content to build anew. Perhaps only these proud warriors see the strategic benefit of capturing them, or see it as a way to restore glory to the Dunmer. It is rumored that a group of Redoran warriors have made efforts to reclaim Marandus and Andasreth in an effort to expand their influence; it is not yet known whether their efforts have been successful. It is a great shame that the Tribunal Temple allows these structures to lie in ruin, as veritable nests of dissent and danger. Perhaps they will reclaim them as they repopulate Vvardenfell, after abandoning it so long ago.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe earliest records of Dunmer strongholds come from the First Era, detailing the unification of the Dwemer and Chimer, who drove the Nords out of Morrowind in the fifth century, and up to the War of the First Council. For example, Dagoth Ur was the supposed ruler of the lost stronghold Kogoruhn. It is likely the other leaders of the First Council held their own strongholds. Some scholars have proposed that this marks the time of their construction, built for the sole purpose of keeping the Dwemer in check and opposing the Nord invasion. The Chimer had enough political organization to conduct such a massive undertaking in this period, whereas Dunmer lacked the required organization and manpower in later eras. However, the question remains what came first, the First Council or the strongholds? Whether or not these massive structures were constructed in a mere century remains a mystery to scholars. However, we can theorize on what they were used for during this period. Dunmer strongholds are more suitable garrisons than ancient Velothi architecture. They are death traps under the guard of a few bandits. Paired with an organized military, the would prove impenetrable.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMany stronghold are strategically placed along Vvardenfell's coast. Scholars have argued whether the strongholds were constructed to repel Nords or keep the Dwemer in check. Placement along the coast would allow the Chimer to repel Nordic invaders from sea. Most strongholds lie on the northern and western coasts, where Nords were most likely to invade, and fewer built in the east and south. However, the strongholds tend to be far apart. Each stronghold would have to have its own army to defend it, and perhaps did, but what makes them truly strategically viable is its teleportation system, known as propylons.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Propylon Travel System<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Propylon chambers are the Chimer's greatest feat of magical engineering. Each chamber contains two propylons, set to teleport someone to a propylon chamber in another stronghold. These propylons are chained so travelers can jump from chamber to chamber until they reach the correct stronghold. The propylon chain circumnavigates the strongholds around the island (see map). The propylons require an index: a magical key that looks like a small, roughly hewn, oblong gemstone. Each index is keyed to a specific propylon, requiring a full set of indexes to jump from one propylon chamber to another in a complete circle. The propylon chamber lies in a separate structure on top of the stronghold, so navigating the stronghold itself is unnecessary when using the teleportation system.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Chimer likely used these propylons to move troops from one location to another, thus requiring less manpower to defend each stronghold against the Nords. This form of teleportation would also politically unify the Chimer by making it easier for the First Council to organize. All ten known strongholds are connected, leaving the lost stronghold Kogoruhn out of the loop. The Dunmer must have still known how to engineer propylons during the Battle of Red Moutain, resetting the propylon chambers to exclude the stronghold of Dagoth Ur. The propylons requiring an index to function means the lord of a stronghold had the power to prevent unwanted factions from entering, and others to pass unhindered. It is an open, yet controlled travel system.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMost propylon indexes are lost. Hopefully at least one index for each propylon still exists, scattered throughout Vvardenfell. Until these indexes are recovered, it is unlikely any large scale attempt will be made to repopulate the strongholds. Restoring the propylon network would create new avenues of travel, opening up new areas of exploration and colonization. These great strongholds have long awaited its people to return and reclaim them. They are a testament to the once glorious Chimer, yet remain a forgotten piece of Dunmer heritage. They have the potential to become great cities, and unify, not just the Dunmer, but all people of the Empire living in Vvardenfell.<BR>"

Though most Dwemer artifacts, confiscated from illegal traders, have been given over to the Society, we require proper excavations to further historical research. This operation is primarily based in the Guild of Mages. We offer to bestow the position Chair of Dwemer Studies to any guild member who shows the most promise in this endeavor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThrough this endeavor we are now able to share some of our recent breakthroughs in Dwemer studies. Though we have few theories to offer at this point, we offer our empirical findings for peer review. The primary concern of this publication is the ruins of Vvardenfell, their locations, and the artifacts found within.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOne might ask, is it against the will of the Nine Divines to know the Dwemer? Is their fate designed to teach us the consequences of Dwemeri hubris? Should we be content to let sleeping dogs lie? This has been the position of the Empire, and the Tribunal of Morrowind, for quite some time. It is not our intent to offend those sensibilities by attempting to replicate Dwemer experiments to gain profane knowledge. The intent of the Imperial Historical Society is to shed light on our darkened past. The greater our understanding of the Dwemer, the more we can say about how they went wrong. Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe ruined Dwemer citadels and fortresses lie dotted across Morrowind like great tombs, filled with horrors. Dwarven spectres haunt corridors alongside their centurions, patrolling empty halls in endless futility. Though these places will never truly be safe, we hope to clear some ruins of hidden dangers, so we may study the long lost Dwemer race without fear. We invite adventurers to apply at their nearest Guild of Mages, should they wish to aid us in this task.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis handbook discusses the elements of Dwemer architecture, its machinery, its artifacts, and includes a comprehensive catalogue of Dwemer ruins in Vvardenfell. It is important to know how to spot these ruins, what lies within, and what artifacts are significant to the Society's studies before organizing an expedition.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Dwemer Architecture<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThe Dwemer were master metal-smiths, but their stonework is equally impressive. The exterior architecture is constructed in stone, with metal pipes and round heavy doors merging seamlessly with the stonework. They were master bridge builders; these sturdy structures remain intact to this day. Dwemer ruins are recognizable by large spired towers, steam stacks, and the occasional observatory. Their observatories are domes constructed with perfectly formed metal plates, and house impressive telescopes jutting into the sky. Dwemer architecture was inherently functional, but still suggests a carefully thought out aesthetic in its grand austerity.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough the Dwemer were not overtly fond of imagery, Dwemer statues have been found amongst the ruins. These statues depict Dwemer in long robes, bearing sword and shield, perhaps a testament to their militaristic nature. The stark geometric lines in the sculpted form suggest harshness and practicality in the Dwemer mindset. Dwemer carvings and runes don their stone and pipework. The imagery is primarily astrological, carved deep into the stonework on doors, but their runes have yet to be deciphered. Though Dwemeris bears a distant relationship to other Meric languages, many Dwemer books and inscriptions have proven untranslatable. Nevertheless, to help aid our scholars, a key to the known Dwemer alphabet is provided at the end of this book.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDwemer ruin interiors delve deep underground, often cutting through lava lakes. The larger rooms house machinery, and smaller rooms appear to be sleeping quarters. The presence of furniture such as beds, desks, drawers, and ovens suggest they lived and worked in close proximity. The interior walls are stone, cut and smoothed from living rock like mining tunnels, but the floors are metal. Metal pipes are riveted to the walls in every room and corridor. Our excavations have proven these pipes carry steam, which serves not only to power their machines, but to heat their living spaces. Dwemer lighting is unlike anything seen in Nirn today. They eschewed candles in favor of strange glass tubes with metallic elements. We do not yet understand their inner workings, but most still function to this day.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Threats Within Dwemer Ruins<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nIt is imperative to understand the threats within Dwemer ruins before mounting an expedition. Some artifacts are cursed, so use extreme caution before touching anything. Picking up a cursed item may summon a Dwemer spectre, which throws magical attacks. These spectres can also be found roaming the halls. It is unclear how these spectres came to be. Are they the ghosts of Dwemer who died before their race disappeared? Did they wander the halls alongside their living ancestors? Or are they shadows of the Dwemer who supposedly uncreated themselves? In either case, they do not take kindly to intruders. Enchanted or silver weapons are required to defeat them. They also have the ability to reflect spells, so be prepared before throwing a fireball at them. Like other ghosts, they are also a source of ectoplasm, which is of some value to alchemists.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe greater threat comes from Dwemer centurions. Those still active will attack intruders on sight. In the next section we classify the known types of Dwemer annimunculi, and how to defend against their attacks.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Classifications of Dwemer Animunculi<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThree distinct types of Dwemer annimunculi have been found in the ruins of Morrowind. Some are still active to this day, and pose a dire threat to our excavation teams. It is not known how these creatures are powered. Some scholars believe the Dwemer harnessed the power of the Heart of Lorkhan, and that annimunculi can only function in close proximity to Red Mountain. However, the discovery of other forms of Dwemer annimunculi in Hammerfell is evidence that annimunculi may draw their power from a different source. Dwemer centurions are relentless in their task to eradicate intruders in the fortresses they were designed to protect, even in the absence of their masters. Note that though scrap metal is of use to alchemists, it has greater academic value to the Imperial Historical Society.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Centurion Spider:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is the most common construct found in the ruins. It is the weakest of the three centurion types, so it is more likely they were used as a warning system than guards. Their primary attack is poison, expelled from a large gas bag. The gas bag rests on a metal base, attached to six hinged legs. Centurion spiders are quick, but they break easily in combat. Damaging either the gas bag or the legs will put this construct out of commission. If you can, try to damage only the legs. If the gas bag is ruptured, our research teams cannot reconstruct them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Centurion Sphere:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis construct is the primary guard force in Dwemer fortresses. The sphere centurion has a complex gyro mechanism, enabling it to balance on top of the sphere and swiftly roll towards its target. It retracts into the sphere when idle, possibly sparing its complex mechanisms from wear when it is not needed. This construct has two arms, allowing it to carry sword and shield, and in its head, a single eye to target its enemy. Its primary attack is melee. Its defense is a lightning shield to protect it from shock damage. If faced against one of these constructs, the first mistake is to go for the eye. They can function almost as well without it, only lacking accuracy in their sword attacks. Instead, hit the gyro mechanism down the lower half of its midsection. Hitting this hard enough will cause it to fall apart at the seams. Note that our research teams have not yet had success reconstructing this centurion type. Hitting the gyro, even with magical attacks, causes irreparable damage to its delicate internal mechanisms. However, there is no other known way to stop them, and our excavation teams' safety is our primary concern.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Steam Centurion:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis lumbering war machine can crush its enemies as slowly and steadily as a rock. Steam centurions are rarely found in the ruins, possibly because many were spent during the Battle of Red Mountain. These constructs were designed for war rather than light guard duties. Their heavy metal bodies are stabilized on two massive legs. The clank of a steam centurion approaching causes immediate instinctual fear in even the hardiest warriors. Its appearance as a towering armored warrior must have also been designed for psychological effect. They must have dominated the battlefield in their time. On top of being difficult to damage physically, these hardy constructs are also resistant to magical attacks. One of its powerful arms acts as a massive mace, able to crush even heavily armored opponents. Its other hand is unarmed, free to grapple and draw its opponent into range of its crushing blows. This creature has no magical attacks, but its physical attacks are deadly enough. Our primary advice to our excavation teams, if faced with one of these monstrosities, is run. Run out of the ruin and regroup. Do not attempt to engage this construct alone, and trust that the Guild of Fighters is always for hire.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Types of Dwemer Mechanisms<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nIt is important for an expedition to recognize the hallmarks of Dwemer mechanisms. Please do not attempt to dismantle any large mechanical devices found in the ruins. The Imperial Historical Society prefers them intact so we may study how they function in their environment.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe are still uncertain about the purpose of most Dwemer machinery, but we do know the majority is powered by a combination of steam and magicka. Many machines are still running to this day, a testament to Dwemer engineering. They are connected by a vast series of pipes, and comprise of mighty pumps with spinning cogs, wheels, and belts. Only through continued excavation may we glean the function and purpose of these machines.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Dwemer often dug deep into lava pools. To tap this vast resource, they favored regions close to Red Mountain. They also tapped underground water sources, as evidenced by their large and serviceable wells, and channeled them through pipes to be heated by lava. Steam pipes weave throughout the entire fortress. Dwemer machines are powered by the earth itself, an endless resource. It is a testament to Dwemer ingenuity.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Dwemer Telescope:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe telescope represents the Dwemer's most formidable scientific achievement. This grand piece of machinery can be found in large domed observatories, of which few exist. This device once allowed the Dwemer to gaze closely at the stars along the outer edge of Oblivion, and perhaps through the sparkling pinholes to Aetherius itself. In the field of astronomy, the Dwemer excelled beyond all other races. It is a shame that the greater part of this knowledge vanished along with them. Had they not sought such knowledge to such profane ends, who knows what could have been accomplished in the eras that followed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Artifacts of the Dwemer<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThe Imperial Historical Society is in possession of the full range of Dwemer artifacts currently known to exist. We offer this full catalogue to our members, and members of the Guild of Mages currently engaged in Dwemer studies.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Everyday Objects of Dwemer Society<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nDwemer Coins: once the primary currency of the Dwemer race, they have become a staple for illegal trade in Morrowind. It fetches a high value on the black market due to unscrupulous collectors. The Society's greatest interest in Dwemer coins is in studying the alloy, which our alchemists have not yet fully determined.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDwemer Tableware: ornately decorated bowls, goblets, mugs, and pitchers are prized by collectors, so getting our hands on them has required detective work and legal seizure. Studying these objects offers a glimmer of insight into the life of the ancient Dwemer. They represent something small and beautiful in the otherwise grandiose, austere, and forbidding Dwemer complex.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Components of Dwemer Machinery<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThe Dwemer Tube: still remains a mystery to our scholars. The glass tube is capped on both ends with metal. Was it a magicka container, or did it serve a hydraulic or steam powered function? What were these tubes attached to? We must obtain more, along with other key components of Dwemer machinery, to further our research.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Dwemer Cylinder: a type of glass flask, sitting on a metal base, and capped on the top with metal. Our excavation teams have reported these cylinders are a component of Dwemer machinery. They can be found inserted in most machinery found in the ruins. We have yet to determine its exact function. We believe it either served as either magicka containment or steam containment.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Dwemer Coherer: resembles a Dwemer cylinder with two tubes protruding out the sides. Our scholars have proposed this device was used for magicka reception, transmitting magicka from another source, often across great distances, and into the mechanical device it was designed to power.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDwemer Cogs: transfer mechanical power along a device, and are found in most moving parts of Dwemer machinery.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Dwemer Armaments<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThese artifacts are the most rare, but we have examples of nearly every form of weapon and armor currently known. All armaments were constructed with a rare alloy known only to the Dwemer. It is heavier than steel, and resists corrosion and wear. The same metal is used on the plating of Dwemer centurions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDwemer Armor: constructed from the same metal as their centurions, the Dwemer resembled their constructs in battle. A full set covers the whole body, and though it is carefully jointed to minimize gaps and seams, it allows easy movement for the wearer. It is heavy and resistant to blows by lesser metals. Their shields come in the form of a slightly elongated buckler. They are heavy, but small enough to provide better mobility of the shield arm. There is a large groove up the base of the shield, possibly designed to allow the shield barer to disarm an opponent by catching the weapon and drawing it to the side.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDwemer Weapons: are primarilty designed for heavy melee combat. They are all heavily weighted, but have excellent balance. Among these weapons are the battle axe, claymore, halberd, mace, shortsword, spear, war axe, and warhammer. The Dwemer also constructed heavy crossbows for ranged attacks. Our researchers have enlisted the aid of the Guild of Fighters to help enlighten us on possible Dwemer fighting tactics. We plan to release a definitive paper on the subject sometime next year.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Locations of Dwemer Ruins in Vvardenfell<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nAleft: a small ruin located on the northwestern edge of the Bitter Coast. It is southeast of the small fishing village Gnaar Mok, and northwest of the Dunmer stronghold Hlomarn. It is the only Dwemer ruin found in this region. It is currently not of particular interest to the Imperial Historical Society.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nArkngthand: a large ruin that sits atop a mountain in the Molag Amur region, located east of the recently installed Moonmoth Legion Fort. On the road northeast of the fort, a sturdy Dwemer bridge leads directly to the ruin's entrance. This ruin also has a visible observatory, so it is of considerable interest to the Imperial Historical Society.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nArkngthunch-Sturdumz: a small ruin located near the northwestern coast of the West Gash, southwest of Ald Velothi. A large Dwemer bridge leads to the entrance. This ruin is not currently under study of the Imperial Historical Society, but further investigation is pending.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBthanchend: has been identified and sighted within the Ghostfence, near Maar Gan. Due to the inherent danger of venturing into the Red Mountain Region, there are no plans to further investigate. Though it remains tantalizingly just out of arms reach, we warn prospective expeditions not to make any attempt on this ruin.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBthuand: rumored to be somewhere in the central northern Ashlands. The exact location is currently unknown.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBthungthumz: a large ruin located north of Maar Gan, across the foyada that cuts across the northwestern Ashlands like a great scar. Also nearby is the Dwemer ruins of Druscashti. Attempts to enter these ruins have been largely unsuccessful, as few adventurers have returned from their depths. These ruins have been classified as highly dangerous, and should be avoided until a significantly large excavation team can be mustered.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDagoth Ur: the famed final battleground of Lord Nerevar remains a legend. It is rumored to sit in the center of Red Mountain, but the Imperial Historical Society has no plans to uncover it. We insist that no one make any attempt to venture into the Red Mountain region under any circumstances.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDruscashti: located just north of Bthungthumz. See above entry.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGalom Daeus: located deep in the center of the Molag Amur region, west of the landmark known as Uvirith's Grave. An observatory has also been sighted in this ruin, but the Imperial Historical Society has no plans to investigate further at this time. It is of considerable interest for future investigations however.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMzahnch: located on a large island in the southern Azura's Coast region, northeast of Vivec, and southwest of Molag Mar. Current reports suggest that this ruin, though accessible, is of little interest to the Imperial Historical Society. It contains few remaining artifacts, and contains little in the way of machinery.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMzanchend: located in the heart of the Molag Amur region, northwest of Uvirith's Grave, and northeast of Galom Daeus. This ruin is of some interest to the Imperial Historical Society, and further investigations are pending. However, we currently lack the resources to mount a full excavation in this region.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMzuleft: a large ruin located southwest of Dagon Fel on the main island of Sheogorad. This ruin is currently under investigation by the Imperial Historical Society, and there are current plans to mount a full excavation within a few years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNchardahrk: located near Dagon Fel and Mzuleft. The Imperial Historical Society plans to further investigate this ruin as part of the Mzuleft excavation project.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNchardumz: has been located in southeastern Molag Mar, at the end of a large valley along the mountains bordering the Grazelands region. It is not of any particular interest to the Imperial Historical Society.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNchuleft: located in the Grazelands west of Tel Vos, on the mountains bordering Molag Mar. It is of some interest to the Imperial Historical Society, as it is mentioned in the book The Chronicles of Nchuleft. However, this ruin has not yet been investigated by members of the Society.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNchuleftingth: located in Molag Mar, between Mount Kand and Uvirith's Grave. The Imperial Historical Society is currently mounting a full expedition into this ruin, and excavation is well underway. Results are pending.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNchurdamz: located in the eastern Azura's Coast region, and is not to be confused with Nchardumz to the northwest. There are no current investigations into this ruin. However, reports are welcome from adventurers and prospective members of the Imperial Historical Society.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese are the current known locations of the Dwemer ruins in Vvardenfell. There are historical account of others, possibly located deep within the Red Mountain region, but there will be no Society sponsored investigations into this zone.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\DwemerRuins_map.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\dwemeralphabet.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>"

Many shrines have been taken over by cultists, and their numbers present a growing threat to the Temple and the people of Vvardenfell. Our numbers are too few to quell this threat in short order, and our greater task of preserving the Ghostgate keeps our majority fully occupied. We recommend using the manpower available in other factions: we need as many Ordinators, and willing members of House Redoran as can be spared; we need to enlist the aid of foreign factions such as the Imperial Legion and the Guild of Fighters; lastly, we must publish these findings and make them available to wandering adventurers who may choose to aid us. Clearing as many shrines as we can of their worshipers is imperative for the continued safety of our land.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe present to you our findings: a complete survey of the daedric shrines listed by region. Our agents have managed to explore the majority of them without engaging their denizens in combat. Since we have limited manpower available to clear these ruins, we have classified each according to the level of threat it poses so you may better decide which should be dealt with quickly, and which can be left to linger a while longer. We have also provided a map of all currently known shrines in Vvardenfell at the end of this tract.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Ascadian Isles:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAld Sotha: dedicated to Mehrunes Dagon, this large shrine lies on Vivec's doorstep to the northeast. It is currently occupied by a large group, affiliation unknown, and a number of daedra. Because this shrine is one of the pilgrimage sites of the Four Corners of the House of Troubles, we have classified it as a medium threat. Because we are currently unsure of the intentions of its denizens, we recommend it is put on continuous watch for the time being.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Ashlands:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAssarnatamat: dedicated to Mehrunes Dagon, this shrine is located on the foyada southeast of Caldera. This shrine only has a handful of worshipers, but it is crawling with daedra. As the daedra themselves have little interest in causing trouble far from the shrine, it is currently classified as a low threat, but must be approached with extreme caution.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAssurabitashpi: dedicated to Mehrunes Dagon, this shrine is located on the northern shore of the Ashlands near Urshilaku Camp. It is currently occupied by a small group of Altmer worshipers and daedra. It is classified as a low-medium threat and has been put on our watch list.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEbernanit: dedicated to Mehrunes Dagon, this shrine is located in the northern Ashlands, southeast of the stronghold Valenvaryon. It is small, housing only a few Dunmer worshipers and daedra. It is currently classified as a minimal threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRamimilk: dedicated to Molag Bal, this shrine is located southeast of Ald'Ruhn and west of the Ghostgate. There is a small contingent of worshipers here, but they are currently classified as a low threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nZergonipal: dedicated to Malacath, this shrine is located on the northeastern shore of the Ashlands. A small number of orc worshipers currently occupy this shrine. It is classified as a low threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAzura's Coast:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlmurbalarammi: dedicated to Sheogorath, this shrine is located southeast of Molag Mar. A sizable group of worshipers have taken up residence here, but it is currently classified as a medium-low threat, and put on our watch list until we deem further action is required.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBal Fell: dedicated to Sheogorath, this shrine is  located on an island east of Vivec. This large shrine is currently occupied only by daedra, so it is classified as a low threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEsutanamus: dedicated to Molag Bal, this shrine is located on the large island south of Tel Mora. There is a small band of hostile worshipers currently occupying the shrine. However, it is classified as a low threat for the time being.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKaushtarari: dedicated to Malacath, this shrine is located on a tiny island south of Sadrith Mora. There are only a few worshipers to be found here, so we have classified this shrine as a minimal threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShashpilamat: dedicated to Malacath, this shrine is  located on the southeastern shore of Azura's Coast, northwest of the Shrine of Azura. There are only a handful of worshipers occupying this shrine, so it is currently classified as a minimal threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYansirramus: dedicated to Molag Bal, this shrine is located on a sizable island near the coast southwest of Tel Aruhn. There is a growing number of worshipers in this shrine, and a number of daedra roaming outside. It is, however, classified as a medium-low threat, and put on our watch list for the time being.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nZaintiraris: dedicated to Sheogorath, this shrine is located south of Molag Mar. There is a growing number of worshipers here, so it is classified as a medium threat, but has been placed on our watch list until we deem further action is necessary.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Bitter Coast:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAddaddshashanammu: dedicated to Sheogorath, this shrine is located on the western coast on an island northwest of the stronghold Hlomaren. This sizable shrine has quite a few worshipers, but they do not pose an immediate threat. It has been placed in the medium-low threat group and placed on our watch list.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAshalmimilkala: dedicated to Mehrunes Dagon, this shrine is located on the eastern coast, on an island southwest of the stronghold Hlormaren. There are only a handful of worshipers and daedra here. It is classified as a minimal threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAshurnibibi: dedicated to Malacath, this shrine is located on the western shore of the Bitter Coast, northwest of Hla Oad. It is primarily occupied by orc worshipers. Its current threat level is low.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grazelands:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKushtaspi: dedicated to Molag Bal, this shrine is located on the northern coast west of Ahemmusa Camp. There is a small group of worshipers and a few daedra here. However, it is currently classified as a low threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMolag Amur:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAshunartes: dedicated to Malacath, this shrine is located west of Lake Nabia near the stronghold Marandus. It is primarily occupied by a small group of orc worshipers and daedra. We have classified this shrine's threat level as low at this time, but it may increase, so it has been placed on our watch list.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBal Ur: dedicated to Molag Bal, this shrine is located south of Suran up the Nabia river. There is a growing number of cultists in here. Being one of the pilgrimages for the Four Corners of the House of Troubles, it is imperative we clear it of cultists immediately, so it has been classified as a high threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTusenend: dedicated to Molag Bal, this shrine is located southeast of Erabenimsun Camp and north of Mount Assarnibibi. A small group of worshipers have taken up residence here, but it is classified as a low threat. There are a number of daedra wandering outside however, so it must be approached with caution.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSheogorad:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAld Daedroth: =dedicated to several daedra, this large shrine is located on a sizable island due north of Ahemmusa Camp. It is a den of Sheogorath worshipers, who are quickly growing in number. This shrine has been classified as a high threat, and must be cleared immediately.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAssurdirapal: dedicated to Malacath, this shrine is located on the large island west of Sanctus Shrine. It is currently occupied by a small band of orc worshipers, and is classified as a low threat at this time.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnnissiralis: dedicated to Sheogorath, this shrine is located on a small island to the northwest of Sanctus Shrine. There is a sizable group of worshipers here, so it has been classified as a medium threat. It has been placed on a watch list for the time being, but our recommendation is to clear it out as soon as time and resources allow.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe West Gash:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAshalmawia: dedicated to Molag Bal, this large shrine is located near the northern coast, southeast of Ald Velothi. This shrine houses a large mixed group of worshipers, and their numbers are growing. It has been classified as a high threat, particularly to the people of Ald Velothi, as it rests right on their doorstep. We recommend House Redoran, who currently have an outpost near this shrine, be put in charge of clearing it as quickly as possible.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDushariran: dedicated to Malacath, this shrine is located on the road east of the stronghold Berandas. It is currently occupied by a small band of orc worshipers. It is classified as a low threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMaelkashshi: dedicated to Sheogorath, this shrine is located across the mountains northwest of Mar Gaan. The worshipers here are small in number, so it is classified as a low threat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYasammidan: dedicated to Mehrunes Dagon, this shrine is located on the northwestern coast, far west of Ald Velothi and past the ruins of Arkngthunch-Sturdumz. There are only a couple dunmer worshipers here, but it is crawling with daedra. We have classified it as a low threat, but it is to be approached with serious caution.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRed Mountain:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere are a few daedric shrines in this area, and our information on them is vague because we dare not investigate at this time. As they are currently safely contained within the Ghostgate, we have merely put these shrines on watch for external movement. Of these shrines, we know of:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAssalkushalit: a shrine to Sheogorath. We have detected no movement outside this shrine.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nUlarradallaku: a shrine to Mehrunes Dagon. We have only spotted a few wandering atronachs outside.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe also understand there may be cultists creating small shrines and hiding in the underworks of Vivec. We will leave that investigation to the High Ordinators and trust you have the situation well in hand.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\DaedricShrines_map.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>"

This volume is dedicated to the island of Vvardenfell, and boy is it a doozy! You practically trip over Dwemer ruins and Daedric shrines on the roads, making them hard to avoid indeed. With over 30 Daedric shines and at least 20 Dwemer ruins in Vvardenfell alone, that's enough to get you seriously dead several times over if you're not careful.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI would normally recommend not going to Vvardenfell at all, because it's a wild and dangerous place, but sometimes you just can't avoid getting shipped out away from the comfort of your own home. I spent some time in Vvardenfell a few years ago, and I managed to avoid most dangers, so it's entirely possible to survive a trip there. All it takes is some careful investigation: for example, if you're in a town, ask the locals if there's a shrine or ruin nearby nearby. They'll be sure to tell you to keep well away from the place. After all, they've spent their entire lives avoiding those places, because those who don't, don't have the rest of their lives to spend, now do they?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOther places to avoid in Morrowind include: the Dunmer strongholds, which look nice and peaceful from the outside but are usually full of creepy cults and bandits; Velothi towers, which are old-style towers only evil necromancers like to hide in nowadays; and there are also lots and lots of tombs and caves. One word of advice: never ever go into a tomb or a cave, especially anywhere in Morrowind. Dark elves like to summon their ancestors to guard their tombs, so they're full of horrible ghosts and skeletons. Most caves, on the other hand, are full of bandits, because that's where they like to hide, and they don't like being found. Do you know what they do when they're found? They kill you, that's what, so just stay away from caves altogether. If you get caught in the rain and need to find shelter, sometimes it's just better to let yourself get drenched.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe best way to survive in Vvardenfell is to stay in cities and towns, above ground, well away from sewers. Make sure to take the siltstrider to get from place to place. Unfortunately, you'll sometimes find you have to walk when there's no readily safe transport, because Vvardenfell is still really backwards -- they don't even have horses! My advice in previous volumes, such as the Cyrodil volume stating, \"Ride, ride as fast as you can!\" doesn't apply here. If you're forced to walk anywhere, stick to the roads as much as you can. However, if you ever find you've gone down the wrong road or lost your path, here's how to spot all the dangerous places to avoid.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Daedric Shrines<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Daedric shrines in Morrowind are all dedicated to the most terrifying Daedric Princes. I don't know why, but my guess is because the dark elves are rather twisted folk. They used to worship the baddest of the bad, perhaps because they were scared the Daedric Princes would come to Nirn and wreak havoc if they didn't. Anyway, dark elves don't worship Daedra anymore, now called the House of Troubles, because the Tribunal Temple recognizes that these Princes are seriously evil. These shrines are still full of evils, from crazy worshipers to wild Daedra, who will all kill you if you ever have the misfortune of meeting them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI'll list the four Daedric Princes with shrines in Vvardenfell so you realize just how frightening they are:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMalacath:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMalacath is the Daedric Prince of the spurned and the ostracized, the keeper of the Sworn Oath, and the Bloody Curse. He's supposedly created the orcs, and many orcs still worship him. Most orcs aren't very nice at the best of times, but the ones eating strange mushrooms, deep in the throes of Malak worship, are the meanest of all. The horrible ogrim are his servants, and you may still see some stomping around his shrines, if you're unlucky enough to get close to one.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMehrunes Dagon:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Prince of Destruction. He's associated with natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and fire. The dark elves are really familiar with this prince's sphere, since it's a harsh land with a huge volcano in the center, so they have good reason to be terrified of this Daedric Drince. He has many servants, such as scamps, clannfear, and the dreaded dremora.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMolag Bal:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMolag Bal is the Daedric Prince of enslavement, and also known as the King of Rape. He's also the prince of corruption and enjoys causing wars. In other words, he's absolutely terrifying and his followers should be avoided at all costs. I once read he had something to do with creating vampires as well. The nasty daedroth are his servants. Thankfully, you don't see them often unless you happen to accidentally fall through a hole in the ground and end up in a long lost Daedric shrine. If this ever happens, you're probably going to die, so be careful not to fall in holes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSheogorath:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSheogorath is the Daedric Prince of madness. He tends to appear as a harmless old man with the sole purpose of confusing people. His servants, the golden saints, are equally confusing because they're so beautiful, but in truth they're the most frightening and deadly Daedra of all. Not much else is known about Sheogorath, but that's probably for the best. Not surprisingly, his followers are completely insane. They might kill you, or they might not. It all depends on the kind of mood they're in, so it's a good idea to stay away from them entirely just to be on the safe side.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNearly all the shrines in Vvardenfell are dedicated to one of these four Daedric Princes. Only one of them, the Shrine of Azura, is worth visiting at all. Getting there is probably dangerous as well, so I wouldn't bother risking your life to see some musty old shrine nobody even worships anymore.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt's easy enough to spot a Daedric shrine from a distance. They mostly look like stone ruins with tall spiny towers, unlike Dwemer ruins, which are made of metal and have big pointy towers. Dwemer ruins are not safe either, but they're safer to pass by than Daedric ruins because the horrors are mainly contained inside. The first thing you'll notice as you approach a Daedric ruin is something coming at you hurling balls of magic and roaring. If you're ever in the mountains and notice the rocks have strange patterns on them, look around, and once you've picked out the general direction of the ruin, run in the opposite direction as fast as you can!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Dwemer Ruins<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Nobody really knows how the dwarves disappeared, but they left a lot of nasty things behind. Dwemer ruins can be spotted by their large pointed towers. Dwarves were good at working with metal, so their towers have a lot of great big metal bits and pipes stuck all over them. They're usually safe enough from the outside, but inside they're terrifying. They left their centurions guarding the place, set to attack all intruders before they disappeared. Since the dwarves are gone, there's no one left to tell these nasty machines to stop going around killing everything in sight.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI spoke to a crazy adventurer once, who told me about all the kinds of dwemer centurions. There are little spidery ones that shoot poison at you, bigger rolling ones that carry pointy swords, and huge nasty ones that have one great big whumping arm that will crush you dead in an instant. Many of these still wander around inside the ruins, because the dwarves were amazing engineers who built things to last forever, which is unfortunate for the rest of us still living on Nirn. Apparently dwarven ghosts also wander around their ruined cities, and they are very angry. These ghosts like to hurl spells at you, and are immune to most weapons.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy advice to anyone who comes across a Dwemer ruin is to keep walking. They're perfectly harmless from the outside, so don't ever go inside one. Think of them as a big trap, trying to lure you with its promises of fine dwarven loot, which you won't fall for because you're smarter than that.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Dunmer Strongholds<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">These strongholds are big. They're really big. They're big enough to hold enough members of evil death cults and bandits to form their own armies. Think of them as cities of pure evil. They even look evil. Dunmer strongholds are huge dark fortresses squatting on the ground like great big beasts that will swallow you up whole if you get too close to them. They look similar to the cantons in Vivec or Molag Mar, but more evil and menacing. The thought of an entire city of evil sends shivers up my spine. The people of Vvardenfell really need to get their act together and send in armies to clear these places out. Then they could turn them into big fancy cities, with inns with huge marketplaces, and then Vvardenfell might actually be a nice place to visit for a change.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nUnfortunately, that will probably never happen, so don't ever go near a Dunmer stronghold. They have great big platforms on the top, frequently occupied by nasty people who will kill you on sight. There are hostile people inside and out. You probably wouldn't even make it to the door before you're killed. They could be full of bandits, insane cultists, or worse. I've heard tales of people who've been turned into horrible monsters, who worship an ancient evil Dunmer called Dagoth Ur, who is supposedly sitting around Red Mountain planning the end of the world and causing all the blight that's been plaguing Morrowind.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWriting all this down gives me the willies, and I'm probably giving you the willies too, so I'm going to stop talking about this and move on to the next section.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Velothi Towers<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">You might be walking along the road when you spot something that looks like a Tribunal Temple. You might say to yourself, \"Hey I need a few more scrolls of Almsivi Intervention,\" (which are really handy in spiriting you away from the horrible dangerous places you might accidentally stumble upon), \"I think I'll stop over and pick a few up!\" Well, don't be fooled. Tribunal Temples are only found in cities. Is this temple located in a city? No? It's in the middle of the wilderness, you say! Don't go in there! It's not a temple at all; it's an ancient Velothi tower full of skeletons and necromancers!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Ashlander Camps<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Ashlanders are probably nice people for the most part, but they really don't like other people very much. The people in the big Ashlander camps probably won't kill you. In fact, they'll probably trade with you for supplies. The small Ashlander camps, on the other hand, are full of outcasts who like to rob and kill people who happen to pass by. If you are traveling though the Ashlands or the Grazelands and you see one or two yurts (those are the big tents they like to live in) or a couple people huddling near a fire, don't go near them! Alter your course so you stay well away, and try not to be seen. These people are almost 100% guaranteed to be hostile. They will not want to share their fire, or trade with you, or let you sleep in their tent for the night. They will kill you, loot your corpse, and leave your body for the rats to eat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Regions of Vvardenfell<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Some of the regions in Vvardenfell are even more dangerous than others. Not even the roads are safe in some areas, as they often lead to dead ends and really dangerous places. Here I will tell you which regions to avoid, and which are a little more safe to travel through.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYou can travel to most places by siltstrider or boat. The siltstrider is fairly safe, since the caravaners are all good with a bow and can shoot down any cliff racers trying to attack from above. Boats are fairly safe as well, as long as you don't put a single toe in the water. The oceans around Vvardenfell are full of slaughterfish that will eat you alive!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Ascadian Isles:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is one of the few pleasant regions of Vvardenfell. There are plenty safe roads, because there's a good Imperial presence here. There are many farms and plantations around here, and the towns aren't too far apart from each other. You might encounter the odd rat or nix-hound on the road, so bring a friend if you have to travel by foot. Those nix-hounds are pretty nasty. You might also encounter a few cliff racers, which are great big, squawking, flapping, death from above. If you see great big floating things, those are called netches, and the big ones are harmless. Don't get close to the little ones though. Those are betty netches, which are fairly aggressive.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe biggest city in Vvardenfell is Vivec. It's easy to get lost in Vivec, and the underworks are pretty dangerous. Stay up above, and you'll be fine. The place is guarded well by Ordinators, but they're probably the meanest guards you'll ever meet, so try to stay well out of their way. Suran is a smaller town, much nicer since it's not so easy to get lost in. It has some great inns and taverns. You can get to both by boat or siltstrider.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Bitter Coast:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis place is mostly swamps, filled with rats, nix-hounds, mudcrabs, and cliffracers. Mudcrabs are quite slow and stupid, so they're easy to run away from. They're usually carrying some pretty nasty diseases. Actually, most of the creatures in Vvardenfell are carrying horrible diseases, so the less contact you have with them the better.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Bitter Coast is not as dangerous as some places, but it's still pretty nasty. Its only redeeming feature is it's fairly close to the nicer regions of Vvardenfell, so you can get away from there quickly. If you are dropped off by boat in Seyda Neen from the mainland, make your way to Balmora or somewhere nicer as soon as you can. Seyda Neen has a siltstrider, so you can get away from there safely and quickly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe West Gash:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis area is fairly civilized in the south, but gets wilder as you go further north. As you near the mountains, you'll have to watch out for cliff racers. Most of the towns in this region have siltstrider transport, with the exception of Caldera. However, this town has a guild guide at the Guild of Mages, and another guide at the Guild hall in Balmora. It's probably the safest way to travel, so don't ever walk to Caldera.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBalmora and Caldera are two of the safest cities in Vvardenfell. They have nice big walls and lots of guards to protect the place. Balmora has plenty of good inns and taverns as well. You could live your whole life in Balmora and never have to venture anywhere dangerous at all.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Ashlands:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis region is very dangerous. It's full of mountains, and you know what that means? Cliff racers are everywhere! They even fly into town sometimes, and the guards have to kill them before they carry off small children. The Ashlands is a great big barren land filled with ash storms and blight. I wouldn't recommend going there ever, but if you need to go to Ald'ruhn or some other town, they do at least have siltstriders that can take you there safely, and there's also a guild guide at the Mages Guild.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAld'ruhn is not a very nice place though. The Redoran are unfriendly people, and the city is constantly bombarded by ash storms. Never ever travel by foot in the Ashlands. There's really nowhere worth going to that you can't get to by transport. Everywhere else is really dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRed Mountain:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRed Mountain is sealed off by the Temple, because that's where all the blight and other evils come from. The Temple built a giant fence around the place called the \"Ghostgate\" presumably because they're using the ghosts of their ancestors to power the magical fence and keep all the evil inside, but the evil still manages to leak out into all the surrounding areas. Red Mountain sits like a great big boil in the center of the Ashlands. Stay as far far away from this place as possible.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nApparently the Tribunal Temple has a pilgrimage site at the Ghostgate, so I would suggest you stick to the Imperial Cult, which is much safer. At least they don't send you to the most evil place in Nirn to go have a looksee.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMolag Amur:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis region is just like the Ashlands, except with more mountains, boiling lava lakes, ash storms, and blight. There is nowhere worth visiting in this region, except maybe Molag Mar, but this town has proper transport, so you can go there without ever setting foot in Molar Amur itself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAzura's Coast:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is the entire eastern coastline of Vvardenfell, which is dotted with lots of islands. There are lots of strange mushroom trees all over the place, and the crazy Telvanni build their houses out of them. Most of the towns around here are only accessible by ship, and they're all run by the Telvanni. The Telvanni is the Dunmer Great House full of ancient wizards, and they're all mad as loons, every one of them. They're not very friendly either.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Empire built a fortress in their biggest city, Sadrith Mora, only because they had to as a condition of the armistice. You can tell they don't really want to be there, and even the Imperial guards are too scared to poke their heads out of the fort and venture into the mad mushroom town.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI traveled there once by guild guide, because there's a Guild of Mages in Wolverine Hall, and I even dared to venture into Sadrith Mora itself, because I was feeling really brave that day. Anyway, one of the Telvanni guards started yelling at me about a guest pass or something, so I ran back to Wolverine Hall as fast as I could and never ventured outside again for the whole trip.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grazelands:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis region is really pretty, but it's also one of the most dangerous regions of all. In a way, it's kind of like a golden saint. Really beautiful, completely deadly, but promises the finest loot you can imagine (if you actually manage to survive the encounter). In other words, it's not for ordinary people like you and me. Only crazy wizards, heroes, and tough as nails Ashlanders dare wander around a place like that.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grazelands is home to many grazing animals, and by grazing animals, I don't mean fluffy sheep and docile cows. By grazing animals, I mean wild guar, alit, and kagouti, which are all great big bitey two-legged lizards of death. The kagouti even have great big goring horns on their heads. If you ever find yourself face to face with one of these, run as fast as you can! Worse yet, there's apparently a ton of Daedra just roaming around wild and out in the open around here.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere are no towns really worth visiting in this region. Vos is a poor farming village, and Tel Vos is a crazy wizard tower that only crazy people would want to visit.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA friend of mine once dared me to visit Tel Vos because he said I couldn't call myself an adventurer anymore if I refused to go on adventures. So I went to Tel Vos, because I heard Master Aryon is one of the nicest Telvanni around, but in reality he's just as mad as the rest.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMaster Aryon's tower is a big twisty-turny labyrinth, filled with angry ghosts, Daedra, and Dwemer centurions he built himself. I was attacked by a ghost, and tried to hit it, which made the guards angry for some reason, so I had to run. I never did get to meet Master Aryon, because he lives in a huge mushroom in the sky above the tower, and I never use levitation spells because I'm terrified of heights. I think I far prefer living in Cyrodil, because levitation is banned there.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSheogorad:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis region is an archipelago of the northern sea. There, is located a small Nordic settlement called Dagon Fel, but it's hardly worth noting. The rest of the region is full of angry Daedra, evil necromancers, and crazy hermits. It really lives up to its name, you know, being named after Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of the looney bin. I can't think of a single reason for any sane person to visit the place.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus concludes my volume on dangerous places to avoid in Vvardenfell, which happens to be most of them. I hope you join me next time as I take you to far away places in the comfort of your own home and tell you where never to go. In my next volume, I will be visiting Valenwood, and not Solsthiem as I previously promised. I've heard a lot of stories about Solstheim and they're all bad. I also happened to get my fill of Nords while visiting Skyrim, which is detailed in volume IV of my series, Dangerous Places and How to Avoid Them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI hear tell Solstheim is a cold barren little island rife with giant bears, wolves, and crazy naked Nords who keep them as pets. There are practically no civilized towns to speak of. Unless you've taken a post in the East Empire Trading Company, and are forced to go there, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.<BR>"

This report deals primarily with our most current discoveries on the island of Vvardenfell. The uses of each mineral will also be covered so our investors may understand the value in securing these resources for the Empire.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDuring our investigations in Vvardenfell, we have also begun surveying the nearby island of Solstheim. We believe there are significant ebony deposits, and also deposits of Stalhrim, previously believed to exist only in Skyrim itself. We hope our newly established colony succeeds in securing these resources.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEbony:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEbony is a rare volcanic glass, with the majority of these deposits found in abundance in the Vvardenfell region. One of the most precious substances in the Empire, it is protected by Imperial law. It is illegal to mine this ore or export it without an Imperial Charter. Mining this ore is a highly profitable endeavor to the East Empire Company, and we have several legal mining operations in the region.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOur primary mining operation in Vvardenfell is currently the Elith-Pal mine in the northern Ashlands. Other mines are known to us, being run by the local Dunmer Great Houses. Caldera mine is currently run by the Hlaalu. However, rampant corruption has led us to conduct investigations into this operation. The Sudanit mine in the Ashlands is operated by the Redoran, and we currently have no objections to their legal enterprise. The East Empire Company is also investigating potential ebony deposits in Solstheim.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEbony is an extremely hard and durable substance, primarily used to create heavy armor and weapons. However, its weight and value prohibits extensive use for such purposes. Ebony weapons are sought after by the wealthy, because it not only holds a sharp edge, but its weight can deal crushing blows, so long as the weapon is properly balanced. Only the most skilled craftsmen can unlock the true potential of this substance, and it can also absorb incredibly powerful enchantments. Ebony armor is primarily a status symbol, and is useful to lords who want to benefit from substantial protective enchantments. As such, the raw ore fetches a hefty price on the market. Large quantities must be used to create sets of armor, because ebony plates must be cut fairly thick to retain their durability. Once it is cut and polished, ebony gleams the purest black, and is often decorated with gold leaf or inlay.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis ore also has some minor alchemical properties, but again, its weight and value make it not well suited to alchemy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nCure Poison<BR>\r\nFrost Shield<BR>\r\nRestore Speed<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGlass:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother rare volcanic glass found primarily in Vvardenfell, it is also a valuable commodity. Glass is less durable than ebony, but lighter and more flexible. The dunmer people use this ore to create unique armor and weapons that are little known outside of the province. It is our belief that demand for this substance can be increased throughout the Empire, and for this reason we have aggressively secured a number of mines in the province.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe East Empire Company currently has mining operations in Halit mine and Dunirai caverns in the Ashlands, and Dissapla mine in the Grazelands. We have also found a mine in the Red Mountain region, and despite the dangers, have begun to establish a small mining operation in Yassu mine.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGlass can be cut into thinner plates than ebony, yet still maintain its tensile strength. The innate flexibility of glass allows it to be used in lightweight weapons and armor. Glass armor uses other alloys as its base, with glass inlaid into the metalwork. It is superior in strength and durability to other light armors. In the light armor range, glass is also unparalleled in its ability to hold enchantments. Glass blades hold a sharper edge than most metals, which makes for superior swords and axes that are lightweight, flexible, and durable. However, it is not suitable for blunt weapons.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe beneficial alchemical properties of glass are too few to be considered valuable for the purposes of alchemy. The value and weight of this substance also make such uses a complete waste of a valuable mineral.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\nDrain Intelligence<BR>\r\nDrain Strength<BR>\r\nDrain Speed<BR>\r\nFire Shield<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDiamond:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe East Empire Company has discovered diamond deposits in Vvardenfell. One of the most perfectly transparent gemstones, it is also one of the hardest substances on Nirn. It has great value to jewelers and alchemists alike.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere is only one diamond mine in Vvardenfell. Abaelun mine is located in the West Gash region, and is run jointly between the Empire and House Hlaalu. We have not found any significant deposits elsewhere in the province.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDiamonds have several alchemical properties, most quite modest and better served in other substances. Also, their value prohibits extensive use for such purposes. Nevertheless, many alchemists stock this ingredient solely for its rare invisibility effect.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nInvisibility<BR>\r\nReflect<BR>\r\nDetect Key<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEmerald:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough we have not found emerald deposits in Vvardenfell, we do excellent trade importing this rare gem into the province. Emeralds are high in demand by local dunmer jewelers and alchemists; as such, The East Empire Company profits greatly in this area. It has two alchemical properties that make it a valuable ingredient to alchemists.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\nFortify Magicka<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\nDrain Endurance<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRuby:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRuby deposits have not been found in Vvardenfell, so we make steady profits importing this gem into the region. Aside from its use in jewelery, it also has two alchemical properties which make it a valuable commodity to alchemists.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\nDrain Health<BR>\r\nFeather<BR>\r\nRestore Intelligence<BR>\r\nDrain Agility<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAdamantium Ore:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAdamantium is one of the rarest ores on Nirn, and can only be found in the province of Morrowind. Our recent survey of Vvardenfell has found no adamantium deposits on the island. So far this rare metal has only been found in small quantities on the mainland.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough the raw ore itself is incredibly heavy, once refined, it makes armor and weapons of a medium weight. The plates can be hammered thinner than any other known metal and still maintain its extreme durability and strength. Polished adamantium shines brighter than silver and, unlike silver, does not tarnish. In the medium armor range, adamantium is also superior to any other metal in its enchantment value. Because of its rarity and quality, only the extremely wealthy can afford armor made from this precious metal. It is in high demand by the High Imperial Royal Guard. The East Empire Company is currently working to secure significant quantities of this metal to supply His Imperial Majesty.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAchemical Properties:<BR>\r\nBurden<BR>\r\nRestore Magicka<BR>\r\nPoison<BR>\r\nReflect<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStalhrim:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis extremely rare material has been found in Solstheim, once used by ancient nords in their burial rituals. It can be used to fashion high quality medium armor and weapons. The East Empire Company has a vested interest in claiming deposits of this rare ore in Solstheim. It has some interesting alchemical properties, but its value and rarity makes such uses prohibitive.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlchemical Properties:<BR>\r\nResist Frost<BR>\r\nFrost Damage<BR>\r\nParalyze<BR>\r\nRestore Health<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMap of Known Imperial Mines in Vvardenfell<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\mineralsurvey_map.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>"

      "text": "<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\r\nThe Complete Blacksmith: Morrowind Edition<BR><BR>\r\nby Charles Alton Wayn<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nIn this complete guide to weaponry and repair, weapons will be discussed by material rather than type, as it is important to familiarize yourself with each material technique. With this foundation, even a novice can complete basic field repairs, and it is a handy reference to any blacksmith working with unfamiliar materials. Of course, each weapon type has its nuances. You cannot learn how to balance a weapon from a book; that kind of teaching is better left to the tutelage of a master.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Iron<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nWorking with iron is simple, and the materials are inexpensive. As such, these weapons are fairly common. However, because iron is so malleable, it regularly buckles and loses its edge. It is easily broken and cleaved by weapons made of stronger materials.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIron clubs, axes, and war hammers are reliable and their construction is simple. Nordic battle axes are also constructed from iron. These weapons are cast, and their heads mounted on iron shafts, which are riveted or bound with leather and resin. A hand-held sharpening stone can put the edge back on an iron axe head, so they can be easily repaired in the field.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIron blades are forged and hammered into shape, then sharpened. These blades can break and lose their edge, but they are easily repaired. They must also be oiled frequently to prevent rusting. Iron broadswords are effective weapons; longer, thinner blades such as longswords and claymores are more prone to fail in heavy battle. As such, they are primarily used as inexpensive training weapons.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Steel<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nSteel is one of the most reliable materials for weapon construction. Properly tempered, steel is both strong and flexible, making it the perfect choice for long blades. This common material is also easily obtained and repaired in the field. Steel weapons are preferred in military use, as they are inexpensive and reliable.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWestern blade forging employs different techniques than Akavirian forging.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe western technique begins with wrought iron rods, which are fired in a hot forge in a case with powdered carbon for up to four hours. The bars are then twisted together with tongs to form the core of the blade including the tang, which will form the core of the handle. The twisted rods are placed back in the forge and heated until red. A flux is then applied to help weld the metal. This is fired to white heat and hammer welded along the full length of the rods until flattened and completely welded. It must be fired to white heat, as it cools to red several times before the process is complete. It is then allowed to cool slightly, then placed back into the fire while the billet is prepared.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTwo steel billets are cut to the desired length of the blade. These are heated to white hot and folded in half into a tight V shape lengthwise. The billets are then fit along the length of each side of the hot iron rod to form the edges of the sword. The steel billets are hammer welded to the iron core. It is then cooled to red hot and flux is applied before re-firing. The sword is repeatedly fired to white heat, and hammer welded along the entire length of the blade. Once it is completely welded, the point is formed. The tang is then cut, and the fuller is shaped, which is the long trench along the center of the blade.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt this point the sword is allowed to cool before the blade is filed, ground, and polished. The blade is then fired again to temper the steel. The steel is heated to a faint red and quenched several times in rapid succession. This will strengthen the blade so it will keep its sharp edge.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAn iron bar is hammer welded to the tang just above the blade to create the cross guard. A wooden or iron grip is then cut to size and bored, which is then affixed to the tang using hot resin. The pommel is then constructed from soft metal, which is threaded onto the end of the tang. For sabers, the guard and pommel are constructed separately before being affixed to the tang.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNordic steel blades are highly ornate. A light acid is applied to the blade in a decorative pattern to etch the blade as the final step of the sword making process.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAkavirian techniques are quite different, and create blades of superior strength and flexibility. This technique is employed to create katanas, tantos, and wakizashis, as well as finer daggers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Akavirian technique employs two types of steel, each of varying carbon content. This steel is made by heating iron in a forge with a carbon casing while continuously using air bellows to precisely control the temperature. A softer low carbon steel is made first, and heated in the forge until yellow hot. This is hammered until elongated and folded over several times. Once the steel has been folded and welded ten times over, it is hammered into a long thin metal wedge. This forms the core of the sword, and is set aside as the jacket steel is prepared.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe jacket steel is a harder steel with a higher carbon content. It is hammered out until it is slightly longer than the core steel. This is then reheated and wrapped around the hot core. These are then heated and hammer welded together in a similar manner to the western method above. After the two pieces of steel are completely joined with no seams, it is hammered to the desired length and a slight curvature is added to the blade.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt this point the blade is ground and shaped. The edge is not sharpened, nor is the blade polished at this time. A course stone is rubbed along the blade to provide adhesion for the clay that is applied during the heat treating process.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeat treating the blade requires it to be first coated with a clay mixture. This controls the temperature and relative cooling of the blade, in much the same way as oil quenching, which is done to gradually cool the metal, and used to create the steel tools employed by smiths. A thick layer of clay is applied along the top and upper sides of the blade, and a much thinner layer along the edge. This is applied in a pattern which will be visible and add to the sword's beauty and worth. The blade is then set aside and the clay allowed to dry for about an hour.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt this point, the blade is heated in the forge, slowly pulled back and forth through the hot coals until it has been uniformly heated bright red-orange. This is typically done at night, so the color of the heat can be accurately observed. Once the blade attains the desired heat, it is plunged into cold water. The blade must then be tempered by heating it to a faint red and re-quenching again to relieve the stresses that have built up in the blade.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt this point the clay is removed and the curvature of the blade is refined by careful hammering. The blade must then be polished, which is a careful and expert process. It is first rough polished with a metal file in a decorative pattern, and then turned over to the master polisher. First a foundation polish is applied using heavy grit polishing stones. An intermediate polish is then applied using a medium grit stone, and then the finish polish is done with a special paste applied to fine grit stones.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeavier steel weapons are simply cast rather than hammer formed. Axe heads are cast into a basic form, often with a decorative mold, and then the edge of the blade is hammered thin before sharpening and polishing. Steel longbows, on the other hand, are hammer formed in a method similar to the western swordmaking process.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Silver<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nSilver weapons are primarily used against magical creatures, which are immune to physical damage by ordinary weapons. Silver is a soft ductile metal, and as such loses its edge fairly quickly, but its unique properties make it invaluable.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSilver weapons are often cast over a solid iron core to strengthen the weapon. Silver staffs and blade handles are ornate, while the blades themselves are quite plain, as they are hammer welded over an iron core. They must be sharpened frequently, and are easily beaten back into shape. The silver staff is one of the more effective weapons, as it is solid, and often fortified with enchantments.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Chitin and Bonemold<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nChitin and Bonemold are both laminates, which are most effectively employed in the construction of bows and arrows. Chitin shortbows are fairly weak, but bonemold longbows are among the best. Dreugh shell is another laminate used to create weapons such as clubs and staffs.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYou would be correct in thinking chitin not a good material to create daggers, clubs, spears, and war axes, but they do exist. They are some of the least effective weapons you can find. They are often spiked or serrated to increase the damage they are capable of dealing, but this material is too lightweight and flimsy to do any real damage in battle. They also require frequent repair, which is at least simple and utilizes local materials. Chitin weapons are a holdover from early nomadic Ashlanders, who didn't have ready access to imported iron.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRepairing laminate weapons is a fairly simple process involving the heavy application of resins. When pieces of the weapon begin to flake away, they can be bound with heavy twine or leather while the resin sets. Severe breakage requires some replacement material to strengthen the compromised area.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor creating a laminate bow, we will use bonemold as an example. All laminate bows are constructed using a bow form. Today the Dunmer use a wrought iron form clamped onto a wooden backing, but they can be made from any strong material. The iron is hammered to match the exact length and curvature of the bow, then mounted onto the wooden back with pins.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNext, the bone is prepared. These bone slats must match the length of the finished bow. They are cut thin, and tapered, with the thickest part in the center. Thicker, shorter, carved bones are used to build up the center hand grip. These sheets of bone are boiled to remove any residue. They are then stretched over the form, and a hot resin is applied to each layer on each side. The bow is slowly built up from thin slats, and tightly clamped to the form. Once the bow complete, it is then treated with steam for several hours before it is allowed to cool. The clamps are adjusted every hour during the steaming process so the bow gradually fits more tightly over the form. The bow is then set aside, still firmly clamped to the form, for two days to allow the resin to completely set.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnce the bow has set, it is broken away from the bow form and filed and sanded. This is done to place the nocks in the bow and correct any errors in the bow's balance. Once the bow is the correct shape, it is completely coated in a thin resin to waterproof it, and allowed dry for several hours before it is strung for the first time.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBonemold and chitin arrows are constructed out of single long pieces of carved material, and are not laminated. The heads are mounted and secured with a thick resin. These arrows are often fletched with the same materials, which is bone and chitin respectively, as opposed to using feather.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Glass<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nGlass is used to create some of the sharpest blades known in the world. It can hold a sharper edge than any known material, and is incredibly lightweight. It also distributes shock well and is fairly flexible. This means it can be cut into long fine blades that are incredibly study. This incredible material is native to Morrowind, and glass weapons have been created by the finest elven craftsmen for centuries.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese blades are cut out of solid pieces of glass. The craftsman must carefully study the grain of the crystal structure before attempting to shape the stone by knapping. This is the process of gradually chipping away at the stone to create a razor thin edge. Fine chisels are used in this process, and elven craftsmen are able to cut the stone so fine that no traces of this process can be seen.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnce the blade is cut, be it a long blade or an axe head, the stone is mounted in a soft yet durable alloy. This is affixed in place with a combination of resins, and hammered and burnished settings. This metal is also inlaid with smaller pieces of glass to create intricate designs. Axe heads and staffs are mounted with glass spikes, which are equally deadly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGlass is also used to create arrows and light throwing weapons. Glass can be carved into incredibly thin shafts, which are light, strong, and flexible, making them perfectly balanced projectiles.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Ebony<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nRaw ebony is an incredibly heavy material, but a perfectly balanced ebony weapon is one of the most effective and deadly. They are also beautifully crafted and ornate, often decorated in gold, exhibiting the height of elven craftsmanship. Ebony weapons are entirely crafted out of this material, as opposed to glass, which is mounted in metal. This stone can be used to create heavy blunt weapons or finely sharpened blades. These weapons are rare and well worth their weight in gold.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nUnlike glass, ebony is worked hot. When this stone is heated, it becomes somewhat ductile, allowing a smith to form it with hammers. For the most part, ebony is carved into shape, since it cannot bend far. The stone is heated until it begins to glow a dull red, then hammered with a hot chisel. The stone becomes almost soft, allowing incredibly smooth cuts. Working with this stone cold results in tiny fractures that compromise the strength of the material, eventually leading to breakage.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnce the weapon is carved, it is heated again, which results in a gleaming polish. At this point the gold leaf is applied while the stone is still warm, requiring no resins to set it in place. The weapon is then allowed to air cool. Hot ebony must never be quenched, because the shock would cause the stone to shatter.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Deadric<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nDeadric weapons are also made of ebony, but they are infused with the souls of lesser Deadra. These are entirely constructed by Deadra in Oblivion. As such, these weapons are incredibly rare in our world. Deadric weapons can be temporarily summoned and bound to the caster using conjuration spells. These weapons return to Oblivion the moment the spell wears off.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese weapons cannot be made by mortal kind, but they can be repaired. Repairs must be done at night, as this is the time when the shroud of Oblivion is not obscured. They must also be repaired with the same care and considerations as other ebony weapons.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Dwemer<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThe Dwemer were expert metallurgists and master craftsmen. Their weapons, though heavy, are perfectly balanced. These are created out of alloys, the secrets of which have been lost to time. Unfortunately, the ban on trade in Dwemer artifacts means few blacksmiths have had the opportunity to study these weapons, so not much is known about them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Forging and Tempering Color Chart<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\armor_temperaturechart.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>"

This handy reference will familiarize you with the construction of armor unique to this province, as well as some old familiar techniques. Of course, the best way to learn how to create these special types of armor is to travel and seek the guidance of masters. This guide will provide you with the basic knowledge you'll need not to look like a fool when you attempt to repair unfamiliar armors, but really the best way of learning is by doing.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Nordic Fur<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nNords are best known for creating light leather armor out of the hides of animals native to Skyrim and Solstheim, such as the bear and wolf. This armor provides comfort and warmth, and is light and flexible. However, it does not offer great protection in battle. It can be pierced easily by bladed weapons, and offers little protection from blunt trauma. This armor is best employed by hunters, as it offers the best protection from animal attacks and wayward arrows. Nordic bear armor is a heavier type of fur armor, which often dons the bear's full head as a helm. It is classified as a medium type armor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFur armor is constructed using tanned hides and heavy stitching. The leather is carefully treated so it does not lose its fur. Thick hides are generally preferred. Tannins such as dung or urine are not used in this process. Instead, the process of brain tanning is employed. Oddly enough, each animal has just enough brains to tan its own hide, so tanning is often done in the field soon after skinning. Nords traditionally believe brain tanning infuses the hide with the spirit of the animal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAfter the hide is stretched across wooden stakes, it is fleshed using stone or bone tools. All meat and fat must be removed, leaving nothing but clean skin on the flesh side. After this is done, the brains are boiled in water and applied to the entire skin side of the hide. The hide is then left out in the sun for eight hours before submerging in water overnight.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe next morning, the hide is re-staked and allowed to drain before working the hide over with a graining tool: a smooth stick with a round blunted point that fits comfortably in the hand. The hide must be worked until it is completely dry or else it will stiffen. Once the hide is dry, it is carefully worked by rubbing, skin-side down, over a smooth tree branch. The heat and friction will break up the grain further and complete the drying process. These hides can then be form molded by smoke curing, as opposed to boiling, which will prevent it from stiffening again on contact with water. When treating the hides you want them to retain their softness and elasticity.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor heavier leather armor, such as the Nordic leather shield, this is treated with tannins, and boiling and waxing the leather. The leather will become incredibly stiff; it will not be possible to stitch together after this point. Instead, holes must be punched before the final treatment in the tanning process, and the leather is stitched over the shield frame using leather bindings before the final curing.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe warmth this armor provides, as well as its low cost, make it an excellent choice for hunting expeditions in colder regions. It is hardly suitable for most other purposes however. As such, it is hardly a popular choice in Morrowind.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Netch Leather<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThis armor is unique to the Dunmer people. It is made with netch hide, which is native to Vvardenfell. Typically found in the Ascadian Isles, the netch is a large floating creature, held aloft by internal gasses in its body. The hide of the bull netch is sturdy and supple, and makes leather armor of superior quality. The netch is also an incredibly large creature, providing ample skin to work with in a single kill. Netch leather is also thinner and more durable than other leather types.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNetch armor comes in two varieties: in full sets of soft leather armor, and boiled helms and cuirasses. Because the netch has a smooth skin, de-furring the hide is not necessary. After the skin is fleshed with stone or bone tools, it is tanned. First the hide is bated using dung, which is rubbed into the skin. This relaxes the leather and prepares it for tanning. The dung is then washed from the hide and soaked by hanging the hide in a pit filled with water and crushed bark, which is the source of the tannins. The hide is soaked like this for two days before it is spread out to dry.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis tanning process leaves the leather soft and supple. It can be easily stitched and formed before steam curing or boiling. Steam curing allows the leather to retain its softness even after it is formed, and it must be worked with a graining tool during this process. Boiling will create a much harder and sturdier armor, but it loses its flexibility. For this reason, only helms and cuirasses are treated in this manner.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis armor is comfortable and affordable, and utilizes native materials. As such, it is the armor of choice amongst the Ashlanders and other peoples of Morrowind. It does not offer much in the way of protection in battle, but for daily protection it is quite suitable.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Imperial Studded Leather<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThis armor is imported from the mainland. As such, it is not commonly used in Vvardenfell, save for members of the Imperial Legion. The leather is tanned and cured in much the same way as other leather armors, after which studs are imbedded in the leather. The imbedded metal studs offer greater protection from bladed weapons, but little protection from blunt weapons. This armor is typically used during training rather than in battle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Chitin<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nChitin is a type of light plate armor native to Vvardenfell, and is commonly favored by nomads and Ashlanders. It is constructed by laminating several layers of insect shell, glued with organic resins. The materials are gathered from the various species of kwama native to Vvardenfell, and other insects such as the shalk are used to provide the resins. Creating chitin armor is a time consuming process, but since it only requires local materials, it is cheap, easily produced, and commonly found in this province.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe armor plates are boiled, then carefully cut. The boiling process softens the plates so they can be worked. The layers are pressed together with wooden blocks after the resin is applied. The layered plates are then stretched, as much as they can be, and tied over a dummy form. The formed plates are steam treated in place to complete the lamination process, then lacquered.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChitin is also used to create weapons, which are light and flexible. The edges are typically serrated because the blades cannot hold the superior edges of metal or glass. However, they are native and affordable, so they are quite commonly found.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis armor is light and comfortable. Though it lacks the suppleness of leather armors, it is jointed and formed in a way that provides maximum flexibility. It is more resistant to blunt trauma, but can be easily penetrated by heavy bladed weapons. The closed chitin helms provide excellent protection from ash storms, and are therefore worn by many Dunmer living in Vvardenfell.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Glass<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nGlass armor is the paramount of light armor. Its delicate and ornate elven design is unusual, but it happens to be one of the superior armors of the world. It is also the most enchantable of light armors. Glass armor is difficult to make, and expensive. The material costs alone mean only finest Dunmer craftsmen dare touch it. Nevertheless, it is important for any armorer to familiarize himself with the basics of its construction.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe base plates of glass armor are constructed much in the same way as any plate armor. The joints are incredibly tight and precise, allowing for greater ease of movement. The plates are forged out of rare metals and embedded with large glass studs. The metal alone is soft and not suitable for armor; the glass studs provide its true strength. The metal's softness allows it to be easily carved with graving tools and set with glass stones.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe settings are typically done by cold forming. The designs are embossed by chasing, which is working with a hammer and chisel along the top side of the metal plate. A graver is used to cut the bezel. This seat is cut deep, and perfectly shaped to the stone. Once the stone is fit, a setting punch and hammer is used to carefully form a wall of metal around the stone. The metal is then burnished, which work-hardens the soft metal so it holds the stone firm. Often, a hot resin is lightly applied to the interior of the bezels before setting, which helps keep the stones firmly glued in place.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHeat is not recommended when repairing these armors, nor is it required. The metal is soft enough to work with cold. A small hammer and a light touch is needed. Broken glass stones can be replaced and set with hot resin. Some cutting with graving tools might be required to accommodate the new stone's shape, and the metal can be pushed back up around it to tighten the fit.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGlass armor is lightweight, highly flexible, and stronger than steel. It is resistant to bladed weapons, and distributes shock well, making it highly resistant to blunt force. It is in fact stronger than most medium armors. The volcanic glass also produces blades of unparalleled sharpness. These weapons are light, flexible, and sturdy, making them much sought after. This armor is favored by the Buoyant Armigers of Vvardenfell, many of whom are nobles of Great House Indoril. Glass creates a light battle armor of the highest quality.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe next volume of The Armorer's Handbook will cover medium armor, and how to create and repair chain, ring, and scale mail, as well as some types of light plate and heavier laminates.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Tools of the Trade<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\armor_tools.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>"

This handy reference will familiarize you with the construction of armor unique to this province, as well as some old familiar techniques. Of course, the best way to learn how to create these special types of armor is to travel and seek the guidance of masters. This guide will provide you with the basic knowledge you'll need not to look like a fool when you attempt to repair unfamiliar armors, but really the best way of learning is by doing.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Imperial Chain<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nChain mail is one of the most basic types of metal armor, one of the easiest to produce, and also one of the lightest and most flexible. The chain is woven into tunics and reinforced with heavy leather straps, which is worn loose over a heavy shirt. Imperial chain greaves and pauldrons are actually constructed from light plate with chain mail reinforcing the joints.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMetal rings are created by drawing wire and hammering it into a coil around a metal or wooden mandrel. Individual rings are then cut from the coil. For iron, which is more commonly used, this process is often done cold. This work-hardens the metal, producing strong rings that are only slightly flexible. For steel rings, the process must be done hot, and it is tempered after the mail is completely woven.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nImperial chain mail uses a basic 1 into 4 pattern. This means every link in the pattern goes into four other links. A diagram is provided at the end of this book to illustrate this simple and effective technique. It creates a strong flexible mail that allows the pattern to expand and contract along the body, but not down the body, all without putting stress on individual links.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nImperial chain armor is primarily used by light infantry, guards, and archers of the Imperial Legion. It is more cost effective, easier to repair in the field, and offers more mobility than plate armor. It is nearly impervious to piercing damage by arrows, and highly resistant to slashing damage. However, it does not provide much protection from extreme blunt force.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Imperial Dragonscale<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nImperial dragonscale armor offers nearly double the protection of chain mail, but being more costly to produce, it only used to create helms, cuirasses, and shields. It is the invention of the Tseaci, the Serpent Folk of Akavir. Since it is expensive and difficult to produce, it is uncommon.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe techniques used to create dragonscale armor are long-held secret, but a few conclusions regarding its construction can be made through observation. The scales themselves are tightly riveted onto a foundation -- leather for the cuirass, and metal for the helm and shield. They appear to be made from actual scales. Though not likely the scales of real dragons, they are possibly from a large Akivirian serpent creature.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDragonscale armor is primarily employed by the Imperial Legion, and tends to be a status symbol within their ranks due to its relative expense and rarity.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Nordic Ringmail<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nRing armor is closely related to scale or studded leather armor. It is created by sewing metal rings onto a leather or cloth foundation. Unlike chain mail, the rings are not interlocked. Though this armor does not provide as much protection as chain mail, it is not as heavy, and more flexible. Nords are renowned for their leatherwork, which forms the base of their ring mail.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese simple rings are constructed from thick iron wire. The wire is created by hammering small ingots until they are long and thin, which is then drawn through a plate with a set of tongs. The wire is then heated and quenched to return the metal's ductility so it can be cold formed. Hammering the wire into rings work-hardens the metal, which makes them strong and resistant to further bending. These rings are then sewn onto the leather base armor to create an armor more resistant to piercing and slashing damage.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOf all medium armor classes, ring armor offers the least protection, but is inexpensive to produce. Nordic ringmail armor is typically used by light infantry and archers, as it provides more comfort and mobility in battle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Bonemold<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThis type of armor is native to Morrowind, and used extensively by city guards and nobility in native Dunmer cities. Each Great House of the Dunmer has their own bonemold forms. Bonemold armor, made entirely from bone and resin, has similarities to chitin armor but is stronger and heavier. It is relatively lightweight, but restricts mobility. Training is required to move with ease in this armor, as with any plate armor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBonemold is constructed by carving and shaping bones and shells, and gluing them in place with resins. First, the pieces are carved so they fit together seamlessly. A hot resin is applied, and the bonemold plate is pressed together with wooden blocks and allowed to set. Once the resin is set, the entire piece is immersed in hot water, which will soften the resin just enough so the plate can be formed. The warmed bone plate is then tightly strapped to a dummy form and the resin is allowed to set again. A light coating of hot resin is then applied to entire surface, which waterproofs the plate and hardens the form.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRepairing bonemold armor is not too difficult as it only requires locally found materials. Bonemold does not dent, but does tend to crack. Small cracks can be repaired with a heavy application of resin. Larger cracks require a small wedge of carved bone to fill the damaged area. The bones of any animal can be used, and any resin will do.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBonemold is also used to create quality bows and arrows. The lightness and flexibility of resin infused bone, as well as the readiness of the materials in a land somewhat sparse with trees, make this the common bow of choice in Vvardenfell. The price of bonemold armor varies greatly according to style, and not all styles are equal in their protection. It is all relatively affordable though, and its protection is decent.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Indoril<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nIndoril armor is an ornate, medium weight type of chitin armor native to the Dunmer. This high quality armor is reserved for Ordinators, the guards of the Tribunal Temple. In fact, it is considered a grave insult to the Ordinators to don their sacred armor. Doing so carries a death penalty in Morrowind, and there is no reprieve.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Indoril helm is perhaps the most fascinating. Every Ordinator wears the face of Vehk, or Vivec, one of the gods of the Tribunal, as they are considered his personal guard. The mask covers the entire face. It is a detailed laminate constructed from chitin and resin. The cuirass also mimics the body, with a molded chest and spine. This chitinous laminate is molded over a cloth form, which allows for greater ease of movement. It is also heavily decorated in gold leaf.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHer Hand's armor is a heavy variant of Indoril armor worn by the High Ordinators of Mournhold. It too is sacred to the Dunmer, and carries the same death penalty if worn by outsiders. It is a laminate constructed in a similar manner to Indoril armor, but covers more of the body.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Dreugh<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThis armor is another type of laminate composed entirely from dreugh shells. The dreugh is a dangerous waterborne creature, and its single massive claw is used to make shields. A helm and cuirass are also made from dreugh shell, as well as a couple blunt weapons. The dreugh's outer shell is thick and sturdy, and it creates a tough armor that doesn't sacrifice mobility.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDreugh armor is made in much the same way as other laminates. It can be slightly tougher to repair, as the materials are not as readily found as bone or chitin, but it can be easily patched using other materials.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Orcish<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nOrcish armor is a light steel plate. It is ornate and based on elven designs. Worn over padded clothing, it offers more comfort and mobility than other steel plate armors. These armors are prized for their craftsmanship, and are fairly expensive to produce. Orcish plate can also hold decent enchantments.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOrcish craftsmen hammer the steel plates into thin sheets, which is then annealed after it is formed. The annealing process heats the metal to a temperature that softens the metal, and is then cooled by quenching in water. The steel is then worked cold with hammers and chisels to create the embossed designs using a technique called repousse. Repousse is working from the back of the metal plate to raise elements along the front. Afterward, the metal is chased, which is embossing from the front of the panel to work detail into the raised elements. The finished plates are then polished, and either linked or riveted in place.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis armor offers excellent protection and mobility. It is relatively lightweight, and favored by both Orcs and Imperial soldiers. However, it is quite rare and incredibly expensive. Most Orcish armor has been passed down family lines for generations, so great care must be taken when repairing this armor. A delicate touch must be used, as the plate is thin and it would be a terrible shame to damage the ornate embossed designs. Small hammers are typically used to repair this type of armor, and minimal heat is applied.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Adamantium<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nAdamantium is a type of ore unique to the Morrowind mainland. This metal has incredible properties, used to produce a lightweight plate armor that can hold the highest enchantments in the medium armor class. Adamantium can be hammered into paper thin sheets and still remain stronger than steel. Adamantium ore is incredibly rare, so it, and its armor fetches a high price on the market.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAdamantium is difficult to work with, requiring extreme heat to smelt and create ingots. Also, this metal cannot be brazed or soldered; the metal will not fuse with an alloy of a lower melting point, so soldered joints will simply crack and flake away. Adamantium ingots must be close to the exact mass required to create a single plate. If the amount is short, attempting to fuse the metal will cause the plates to buckle and crack, requiring the smith to start over from scratch. Once the plate is hammered to the right size and thickness, the metal must be heated before it can be cut with a sharp punch.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo hammer adamantium into plates, the metal must be heated until bright yellow hot. Once the plates are thin enough to be formed, they can be worked cold with frequent annealing. The metal is then polished with a planishing hammer. The planishing hammer has two sides: a slightly rounded face on one, and a flat face with rounded edge on the other. The rounded face is used, and must be frequently polished with rouge and a soft cloth. Blows are struck in rapid succession, at a steady rate, evenly across the metal's surface. This creates an even polish across the plate, which can then be finished with a light application of rouge. Adamantium can be lightly embossed using chasing tools, creating an elegant finished product.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe finished plates are either linked or riveted in place. These rivets, made from adamantium wire, can be incredibly small and made barely visible on the surface. They are often hidden by lightly chased designs along the plates' edges.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRepairing Adamantium requires high heat and a heavy hammer, and dents can be worked out quite easily. It is difficult to cut through, even with a heavy war axe, being nearly impervious to piercing or slashing damage. However, if it does somehow develop a crack, it can only be patched in the field by riveting a plate over top the damage. A full repair requires the manufacture of a replacement plate. Thankfully, this kind of damage is incredibly rare. Adamantium, unlike iron or steel, does not rust, so oiling this armor is unnecessary.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother interesting property of adamantium is it changes color when heated. Its surface will transform through the full color spectrum as the temperature rises. This color is removed during the polishing process, but has its uses in blacksmithing. Each color coincides with a specific temperature. This, combined with its incredibly high melting point, means small adamantium plates can be used as temperature gauges in forges.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Ice Armor<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nIce armor is created by a rare Nordic ore called stalhrim. Stalhrim is a type of glass, similar to ebony, rather than a metal. Used by ancient Nords in their burial rituals, it is only found in Skyrim and the island of Solstheim. It is incredibly rare, so armor and weapons made from this material are almost unheard of. Its enchantment value is mid-range, but it offers the highest level of protection in the medium armor class.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStalhrim is not as supple as ebony when heated. In fact, it seems to defy heat altogether, remaining inert no matter what the temperature. The stone must be cut precisely using chisels. Constructing ice armor is closer to masonry than smithing. Stalhrim ore is also lightweight, so even though it can only be thickly cut, it still creates an armor of medium weight.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCrafting armor from stalhrim requires precise measurements. The cut stone is inlaid over a metal base, using an alloy similar to the metal used to create glass armor. The stalhrim is cut to form from large blocks, then mounted onto the metal base using resin coated pins. Smaller blocks are cut and inlaid into the finer elements using a liberal application of resins. Stalhrim has a natural polish when cut, and so polishing the finished product is not necessary.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStalhrim is practically impervious to heavy blows, cutting, or piercing damage. Its weak spots lie in the soft base metal it is mounted on. Often the metal base and mounting pins require repair, but repairing the stonework itself is not an issue. You can heat and beat away at the surrounding metal without compromising the strength of the stone.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe next volume of The Armorer's Handbook will cover heavy armor, and how to create and repair scale, plate, and ebony.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">4 into 1 Chain Mail Pattern<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\armor_chain_4into1.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>"

Of course, the best way to learn how to create these special types of armor is to travel and seek the guidance of masters.

Iron can be easily cleaved and dented. In fact, many medium armors offer greater protection than heavy iron plate. Nevertheless, its low cost makes it common for front lines troops in battle. Nords have their own style of iron helms and cuirasses, which are heavier and offer slightly better protection.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nForging iron is one of the oldest techniques in the world. The metal offers little resistance when formed into thick plate. In the field, a heavy hammer and low temperature campfire are enough to repair this armor. Iron armor must be oiled frequently to prevent it from rusting.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Steel Plate<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nSteel, being a strong alloy of iron, is also fairly common. Unlike iron, steel armor has a prominent fauld to protect the groin area, which offers more comfort and mobility than closely formed, fully closed plate grieves. Steel, stronger than iron, can be hammered into thinner plates, which increases its relative comfort and mobility. Steel also does not rust as quickly as iron.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nImperial steel armor is coated with black oxide to prevent corrosion, and also frequently decorated in gold leaf. The joints are protected with chain mail. The fauld and tassets are constructed from chain mail and studded leather. Imperial steel armor also has an open helm, compared to the full closed helm of regular steel armor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSteel is smelted by mixing iron with approximately 2% carbon, the most common source being found in charcoal, which can be obtained by burning wood in a closed forge. The steel ingot is then hammered into thin plates. Once the metal is close to the desired thickness, the metal must be frequently annealed: brought up to a dark red hot before quenching in water. This softens the metal enough to work it cold to create the finished form.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnce the plates are fully formed and cut to size, the steel is polished before it is tempered. Tempering steel makes sure it is neither too soft nor brittle. The steel must be heated evenly and observed carefully in this phase. A slow change in surface color will indicate the steel has reached the correct temperature. If working in the dark, a faint red glow will indicate the steel has reached the correct temperature. Otherwise, one must look carefully at the surface changes in the metal. The surface will change from yellow to brown, and eventually become tinted blue. The steel must be removed from heat and immediately quenched once it reaches this point. This process is repeated several times to create an even temper across the whole plate.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSteel armor is the preferred armor for soldiers in the field. It is relatively easy to maintain; only occasional oiling is necessary to prevent rusting, and dents can be easily repaired in the field. Though steel requires a higher temperature than iron to work with, a simple campfire can be brought up to temperature with a few carefully placed bricks and a set of bellows.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Imperial Silver<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThe Imperial silver helm and cuirass are frequently used in the Imperial Legion and Royal Guard, being finer and more ornate than steel or iron plate. This incredibly thick plate also offers better protection. Real silver is more frequently used in weapons, as most magical creatures are impervious to ordinary weapons, but silver armor is actually a misnomer. This is actually a reference to silver steel, a high carbon steel. It is harder than ordinary steel, and retains a much brighter shine.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Nordic Mail<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nThe Nords have some of the finest mail armor in the world. This heavy armor covers the whole body, and is incredibly hard to penetrate. This hybrid armor offers greater mobility than regular plate and, unlike most mail, is resistant to heavy blows. The armor is lined with fine fur, making it comfortable as well. It is however difficult and costly to produce, making it far out of the price range of the average soldier. The most elegant armor the Nords have ever created, it rivals some of the best elven craftsmanship.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNordic mail is a combination of plate, mail, and scale. The helm, pauldrons, boots, and chestpiece are constructed from heavy plate. This plate is embossed in ornate designs, sometimes leafed with gold. The scales of the cuirass are tightly spaced and affixed to a heavy leather foundation. The chain mail covering the rest of the body is also affixed to a leather foundation; however, it is not considered ring armor because the links are interwoven.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRepairing this armor is complicated. Because the entire thing is affixed to a leather foundation, the plate cannot be heated and repaired before removing it. The chain and scale elements are much easier to replace however.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Ebony<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nEbony is a rare volcanic glass found primarily near the Red Mountain region in Vvardenfell. It is so named because of its black opaque glassy surface. This armor is highly ornate and often decorated in gold leaf. It offers the best protection of any armor and can hold the highest enchantments, only being surpassed in this respect by Daedric armor. Ebony ore is incredibly valuable, so this armor is costly to produce. Its price and rarity means it is typically only affordable to wealthy nobles. It comes as no surprise this armor is worn as a status symbol.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRaw ebony ore is chiseled into thick blocks while cold, then heated to extreme temperatures to carve it into elegant smooth shapes. This glass becomes somewhat ductile when heated, and also acquires a glossy sheen. Therefore, heat is used to polish the final product, and gold leaf is applied with low heat to weld it to the stone. The plates are then affixed to a foundation of cloth or leather using resins.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRepairing ebony requires heating before working it with a hammer, otherwise it will develop small cracks that will compromise the armor's strength. These cracks can be sealed with resins should they develop. Because ebony is somewhat brittle, it cannot sustain repetitive heavy blows or cleaving. It is however nearly impervious to slashing and piercing damage.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEbony armor is incredibly heavy, and does not offer much in the way of mobility. Feather enchantments are often applied to reduce its weight, making the wearer more mobile in battle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Daedric<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nDaedric armor is made from raw ebony. Forged using techniques learned from the Daedra themselves, this deep black armor attains a magical red glow along its edges from the magical substances of the lesser minions of Oblivion used in its creation. Conjuration spells can be used to bind the souls of lesser Daedra into the form of Daedric armor on the caster. However, these effects are temporary and, once the spell wears off, the Daedra is released to Oblivion once more.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis armor is so rare, the price on the open market makes it nearly impossible to buy or sell. It is the strongest armor known in the world, and can also contain the greatest enchantments. As with any armor type, shields are capable of holding the highest enchantments, and Daedric armor is no exception. The Daedric tower shield is the single most enchantable artifact in the world.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBecause of this armor's Daedric nature, it cannot be crafted by mortal kind. It can however be repaired, but great care must be taken. Daedric armor must always be worked on at night, as this is the time when the shroud of Oblivion is not obscured. It must also be worked hot, just as any other ebony armor. Daedric armor is not as prone to cracking under stress as regular ebony armor, so it rarely requires repair.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Dwemer<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nWhen the Dwemer disappeared, they took their secrets of metallurgy with them, and unfortunately the Imperial trade ban on Dwemer artifacts means smiths and armorers have not had much opportunity to study their secrets. This metal is heavier than steel, and highly resistant to corrosion. The Dwemer seemed to use the same alloy used to construct their centurions. It is precisely jointed, and gaps are minimized for better protection. Unfortunately, little more is known about this armor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Full Suit of Plate Armor<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\armor_plate_diagram.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>"

Cliché isn't it? That doesn't mean that it's not true. Secrets can be worth their weight in gold if properly handled. Sometimes secrets are more precious than gold and the sharing of them can get one killed. Wisdom comes from knowing when to share them; and when not to. Remember that dead men tell no tales. If you want to live to tell yours, take care in who you tell them to.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere are many types of secrets: those that are well known, those that are known only to a select group, those only known to one, and those that are not known at all. The master of secrets can quickly determine what type of secret a secret is and use that to her advantage. Hold all of your secrets close, for even those that are widely known may not necessarily be so; for what rich nobleman knows that his faithful wife is sleeping with his rival? His house may know, but who would risk the wrath of their lord? Such is the price and power of secrets; learn how to properly wield it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSome secrets can be discovered by merely listening and watching, others must be hunted down if one knows what to look for. The Webspinner casts her net narrow and wide, sensitive to the merest vibration, ready to pounce on any secret that is captured by her net. Care must be taken in the casting of the web: too large and larger predators may descend. Too small and even the largest secrets may elude your grasp. The inexperienced spinner casts a small web and catches the most obvious secrets, but still proceeds with caution when spending this currency. There is only one chance, fail and it could cost your life. Seek not notoriety, only our Lady Mephala knows the names of the true masters of secrets. Those who become known are not very long for the world of the living; they are but footnotes in the book of secrets -- a warning for those who speak over much. Watch your friends closely; she who tells her secrets has no power. Once given, they can never be taken back.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGo forth and cast your web, but always bear in mind that yours are not the only strands. Take heed where you tread, lest your secrets become another's.<BR>"

A beautiful woman from Hammerfell, she never lacked for suitors. Her marriage to a minor noble was celebrated by her family and helped propel her career in the Legion. Though he was cold and oft times aloof, Jasmine loved her husband, or thought she did. She led an idealistic life, wanting for nothing but love. This she did not know until that fateful day she met me…<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI remember the day well, sitting in the Six Fishes tavern, playing my lute and flirting with the beautiful ladies gathered about me like so many fawns. A wink here, a smile there, I had them all waiting on my very words, breathless anticipation of my next verse. My music filled the air with its sweet sounds of seduction and pleasure. Tales of love lost, beasts defeated, obstacles overcome and lost loves rediscovered entrapped my audience into my carefully created web, set to ensnare the unwary. A high time I had, gleefully flirting, making veiled promises and catching fleeting glimpses. A humble bard from High Rock I was not that night and I enjoyed every minute. That was, until my vision of beauty glided in.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs the door to the tavern opened, all eyes swung to her presence; a noble lady in a less than noble establishment. Dark skin stood out in stark contrast to the creamy wave occupying the floor, though no less lovely for it. Brown eyes swept over the crowd from a face as delicate as any flower before a small smile alighted upon that face which haunts me still. Know, dear reader, that many a bard, yours truly included, have sang about that quickest of love; the love that grasps a hold of one's heart with the merest of glances and refuses to let go. If you were to listen carefully, you would hear the barest of cynicism present when one of the baldric arts sings of such. For we know, more than any another, the falsehood of this love. Or so I thought until I gazed at that flawless skin, those graceful limbs that parted the sea before them, those lips slightly apart, as if a portend of pleasures to come. I stood struck, momentarily forgetting my place, but quickly resuming my song as the hush ascended and conversations began anew. My attention no longer affixed on those lovely morsels arranged before me, I fell into the depths of the eyes that captured me.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe sat alone at a table near where I was singing and politely watched me, though she did not stir for a few moments as the waitress requested her order. With the barest of turns, she laid out her request and returned to me; my heart fluttered then, afraid I would loose her forever. My song finished, I strum my strings as I composed a new one just for her. Listen, dear reader, as I relate it:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"For you to be in my arms,<BR>\r\nMy precious lute.<BR>\r\nPluck your strings, every note one of love.<BR>\r\nTo caress your slender neck,<BR>\r\nEvery tone given freely.<BR>\r\nBringing your song to life,<BR>\r\nFilling my air with your music.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOh how she blushed then! A perfect crimson 'neath a flawless complexion. I must admit the satisfaction I received upon beholding this blush from a rose. I set down my lute and excused myself from the gaggle of beauties arrayed beneath me, some casting glances of pure venom at the Redguard lady who so carelessly stole the attention they so craved. As I carefully navigated the gauntlet of outstretched hands, I made my way to the bar, carefully concealing a note whilst there. As I returned to my seat, I casually brushed against my fair maiden, dropping my note into her lap. Her blush deepened to a ruby glow, the heat of which warmed my back as I made my careful way through a nest of venomous snakes to return to my seat. I picked up my lute and sang to those savage beasts, casting nary a glance at the plucker of my strings as I sang sweetened songs of love and romance. Those jealous hearts soon forgot their venom; fangs were retracted, perceived slights forgotten. My songs finished, I set aside my lute to receive their congratulations, fending off more than one opportunity with a disarming smile and a hint at possibilities. As those lovely flowers swept from the inn, I stole one last glance before ascending the stairs to my room. Oh! How my heart beat inside my chest, fair that it would kill me soon!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI had barely gained my room and set aside my lute when there was the softest of knocks on the door. I swept it open in a rush, the sight of my delicate beauty stopping my arm. She lowered her head demurely before returning to my sight with a slight tilt. Tones of the purest gold issued forth as she addressed me: \"Master Bard, I wish to inform you of my pleasure upon hearing your wondrous tales. I wish to press the question of a private audience with you, if that should please you, good sir.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI released my death grip on the door and flourished a low bow before gently taking of her hand and bestowing it a kiss. \"It would please me to no end, dear lady. Where should you wish this audience to take place? Merely breathe the barest hint and I shall most certainly be there.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHer eyes lit up mischievously as the brilliance of her smile momentarily blinded me. She looked past me into my room before deigning to reply: \"I believe here will suffice, Master Bard, unless there is another place that suits your fancy?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI smiled and stood aside, keeping a firm grip so that I might keep that electrifying contact. \"Here is most suitable, dear lady; I am humbled by your presence.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe smiled and swept into the room, the fragrance of her passing filling my senses. I quickly closed the door as she stood in the middle of the room, turning to take in the sights before returning to me. She smiled coyly and held out her hand to me. I quickly closed the distance between us and took her hand, giving it another gentle kiss before releasing it and enfolding her in my arms. Her head tilted towards me, lips slightly parted, I kissed her deeply, emotions long since forgotten resurfacing and crashing over me. We stood there, outside of time, drinking of each other's passions before I gathered her up in my arms and laid her on the bed. No words were spoken, nor even necessary as we drank of each other until we were both filled. It was all that I could do to prevent being swept away. I kissed her sleepy cheek before laying down my head, exhausted beyond compare. Faint did I feel her quit my bed, a lingering presence and a kiss her parting gifts to me.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSunlight streamed through the window and bathed my face, bringing me once more into the world, away from that sweetest of dreams. Dressing quickly, I settled my debts with the innkeeper and set about, a smile on my face and a new jingle in my pocket. New horizons called to me, but ne'er will I forget that most delicate of flowers; the one who stole the keys to my heart. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCall me foolhardy, gentle reader, a chaser of dreams and catcher of none! Faint I deserve it; but is it not the chasing of dreams that drives men forward? For, without dreams, are we not animals? Fah! To this day I chase after my dream, catching only the merest glimpses; pushing ever forward. I call to you, my delicate flower, thy bard awaits thee!<BR>\r\n"

While the farmer dutifully tended the lands of his fathers, toiling all day in golden fields, his wife dutifully tended hearth and home. Their sons were not so dutiful, and had all sought work in the cities, leaving their aged parents to tend the crops alone. This old couple made a meager living, and the farmer's toil gave him great thirst. Exhausted at the end of every day, the farmer sank into his cups, and his wife despaired of ever knowing him as he once was.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs Last Seed neared, the farmer looked forward to reaping the rewards of his august toil, but instead found a herd of wild, white guar grazing on his crops.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Shoo,\" he yelled, and brandished his sickle, \"Shoo, or I'll make meat of you all and tan your hides.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBut the largest guar spoke: \"We are the sacred guar of the Temple. Killing us is forbidden.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe farmer, fearful but strong of faith, left the sacred guar grazing his fields. Every night he prayed to ALMSIVI that they would leave, but every day they continued to eat and trample his wickwheat. After three days of nothing but drink and despair, he'd had enough. He went into the fields to slaughter them, and mounted the head of the finest white guar on his mantle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHis wife feared to gaze into the eyes of the dead white guar, but feared her husband in that moment all the more. That night, she prayed to ALMSIVI for forgiveness.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe next night the farmer heard a terrible noise outside his door. He ran outside, brandishing his pitchfork, and found a pack of nix-hounds harassing his prized guar.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Stop,\" he yelled, \"or this pitchfork will find its way into your spleens.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe largest of the nix-hounds laughed. \"You'll do no such thing. We are the hunting hounds of blessed Almalexia. She demands your guar as tribute.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Blessed Almalexia would not keep such base creatures.\" The farmer drove the nix-hounds off, but the damage was done: they'd left his prized guar dead. That night his wife prayed to ALMSIVI for peace.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOver the next few days, the farmer tried to salvage his harvest. As he brought the last vegetables into the cellar, he stumbled upon a rat eating his ash yams.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe mangy beast stopped chewing to chuckle, and said, \"I am the sacred rat of the sewers of Vivec.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Ridiculous,\" the farmer exclaimed, \"Sacred rat indeed!\" And with that, the farmer slit the rat's throat with a knife.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThat evening the farmer ate rat pie and drowned himself in drink. Later that night, his wife found him unusually fit in bed. As she laid beside him, exhausted in the afterglow, she heard the faint sound of laughter on the wind. She prayed to ALMSIVI for relief.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs Frostfall neared, the farmer's wife rejoiced, for she was with child. But the farmer had no memory of the conception. Despite her being so old and frail, the child grew quickly in her womb, leaving her unable to rise from bed. Her husband tended her, taking on her daily work, and despaired, for they had not enough to feed a new child through the winter.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe gave birth near the end of Sun's Dusk. The child looked healthy and fine, but was far too ravenous. As he suckled, he often bit his mother's breast, until she could no longer stand to feed him. She was too weak to lift the child off her as he cried and beat her with his fists.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe old farmer took the newborn child and spanked him. The child retaliated, biting him on the thumb, then bellowed at him with the voice of a grown man. \"I am the fruit of your sin. If you wish to live the winter, bring to me all the meat and bread you have stored. Tis the will of the gods!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe terrified farmer ran to his larder, and gave the child everything he had. All the guar meat he managed to store, as well as the remains of his harvest, went down the child's gullet. It devoured everything - hair and hide and bone. The creature supped until the poor farmer's cupboards were bare. The thing became more bloated and grotesque with every bite.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I still hunger,\" the creature yelled. \"Old fool, I'll have your beer-soaked bones!\" And with that the creature leapt across the room and devoured the farmer in one gulp -- hair and hide and bone.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Monster!\" the farmer's wife cried, \"How could you eat your own father?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"My father?\" The child cackled and stood as tall as a man, a bloated thing with yellowing flesh, red eyes, and sharp teeth. \"I am a son of Molag Bal. Your husband allowed demons into your home, and now reaps what he has sown. As for you, dear mother, I thank you for your warm womb.\" The creature burst out the door and disappeared into the night, shrieking in the wind of the winter's night.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThat night, the poor farmer's widow wept and prayed to ALMSIVI for justice. The head of the white guar spoke:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Blessed Almalexia already sent someone to protect you from Molag Bal and his servants. It was I, the white guar.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnnotations:<BR>\r\nThe Tale of the White Guar was originally an old Ashlander tale. Modified by the Temple before publication, it originally attributed the protective powers of the white guar to Almalexia's anticipation, Boethiah.<BR>"

Aye, this is the basic character of a guar, but underneath their stubbornness is a deep loyalty. Once you've established a bond with your guar, the beast will follow you to the ends of the world. It remembers its tasks well, and it's steady as a rock. I write this book because our young ones have taken to breeding horses. Horses may be fleet of foot, but they're skittish beasts, not suited to the hard terrain and ash storms of our proud land. It is best we remember how to breed and tame the noble guar, our companions since time immemorial.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGuars are not particularly fast animals, but they are strong and sure of foot. They make ideal pack animals. They are intelligent creatures, so once they learn, they learn for life. Guars prefer to eat roots and tubers, but mostly eat coarse grains, like wickwheat and saltrice. This is the guar's staple diet. It's not a good idea to spoil them on corkbulb and ash yams, but these make a fine treat that can grease the wheels a bit while training them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMost farmers in the Ascadian Isles will tell you a bred guar is better than a tamed one, as they're much easier to break when they're young. However, they'll insist it is the only way, and this is simply not so. Since our people came to this land, guars have been tamed and adapted to our uses for generations. The Ashlanders allow the guars to run wild and free, only claiming one or two from the herd when the need arises. Wild northern guars are hardier beasts than the ones you find bred in the south, so they're well fit for the taking. An adult guar does not take well to breaking, so it's best to catch them young.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPicking the right guar out of a wild herd is a delicate business, and it's usually done with the aid of the Ashlanders. Most Ashlander tribes charge local farmers a reasonable price to capture young wild guar. A yearling is best, since they've just left their mothers. The Ashlanders don't usually take the very young, to avoid having to kill their defensive mothers. Wild northern guars, even if they don't take well to taming, make the best breeding stock. Make sure to carefully examine a new guar for signs of disease before introducing it to the herd.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTaming a guar, whether it's been bred or captured from the wild, takes patience and a strong will. A guar will only accept you as its master if you approach it with a firm gaze, a steady hand, and a calm voice. Guars only attack when threatened, so it's important to make sure the beast gets well accustomed to people. When first breaking the guar, it must be roped before a lead can be tied. Do not try to lead the animal until it's comfortable with its harness. Allow it to stand freely while tied, and try to keep the beast calm. Make sure to pat the beast down frequently, so it gets accustomed to you and other people. It will take several days before the beast is ready for the next step in its training.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe next step is to get the guar accustomed to being led. With a gentle tug on the lead, pull to the side to get it to turn. Make sure your verbal commands are consistent, and it will eventually learn. As soon as the beast gives, make sure to reward it with a tasty ash yam or corkbulb root. Force will not work -- a guar will simply dig its heels in when pushed or pulled. A guar needs to trust its master, and it will go when it feels comfortable. It is your job to make it feel comfortable with you and the job it needs to do.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnce the guar is moving on command, it must get accustomed to difficult terrain. The guar should be led over rocks, brambles, streams, and other obstacles. The guar will try to find the path of least resistance. You want the guar to go straight, and step over any obstacle in its path. The beast will resist at first. It will try to go around, but you must hold firm. Make sure you reward it well when it begins to do what you want, and if it resists, give it time.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs soon as your guar is being led with no trouble, you can begin to pack it. Start with the packing harness, and give it a couple days to get comfortable with its constraints. Keep leading it all the while, and gradually over the next few weeks, start adding weight to the pack. You'll find, once the guar is comfortable, it will take to the extra weight with no trouble. Once this training is complete, you'll have a steady pack animal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPacking is as far as most guars are ever trained, but they can be taught to ride. The Ashlanders are expert guar riders. Once a guar has been taught to pack, it is a little more difficult to get it accustomed to a rider. It's easy enough to put a saddle on a pack guar, but it takes a lot of time and skill to get the beast accustomed to the shifting weight of a rider. Nearly all riding guars are trained by Ashlanders, and they do not give their secrets away. Their price for a good riding guar is steep, so riding guars are rare outside Ashlander tribes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRemember, whatever use you may adapt your guar to, it is your companion. An ill-treated guar will never do what you want, so make sure you always treat it right. Once a guar is used to being used by people, it will take well enough to just about anybody, so long as a deep trust can be established.<BR>"

In my journeys, I've come across many interesting and strange things, one of which are the Orsimer, or Orcs as most call them. An interesting race the Orcs; a tall, green-skinned people with huge tusks protruding from their bottom jaw. From what I've seen of Orcian cuisine, those tusks come in handy ... Anyway, the Orcs (or 'Pariah Folk' as they refer to themselves) are a hardy race whose prowess in battle rivals even the Nords, and that's no small feat. Don't tell that to a Nord, or you'll surely have an ax aimed at your head! Hopefully, my advice in this book will prevent that from happening.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOrcs follow the Daedric Prince Malacath, patron of outcasts or something along those lines; who knows with gods what they patronize? Personally, I like to patronize the local tavern with the prettiest waitresses ... Where was I? Oh right, Malacath. Some scholars claim the Orcs were once Altmer and that Malacath was once called Trinimac before being eaten by Boethiah and expelled from him. I don't know how much of that I believe, but I wasn't about to ask about it. I rather like my neck being attached to my head and would prefer that they not be separated, thank you very much. For those more curious than I, don't bother asking the Altmer, they'll just deny everything and the Orcs may take offense if you imply you doubt their word on the matter; it is my suggestion you look to an unbiased observer, if you can find one. Regardless of where they came from, the Orcs are right at home in Vvardenfell. The harsh climate seems to suit their disposition. Or maybe it's because Malacath despises weakness and it takes a strong will to live outside of the cities. Who knows? Whatever the reason, Orcs are respected even if they aren't well liked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMost of the civilized Orcs one will encounter are members of the Imperial Legion, where their prowess in battle and skill with the forge is well appreciated. They would probably be more appreciated if they bathed, but that's a topic for another book. Don't ever ask an Orc to brush their teeth! I overheard one poor Dunmer suggest it and the Orc he was talking to said he would use the Dunmer's bones to pick his teeth! I don't know if he followed through on his threat, I tend to leave drunk Orcs (and Nords) well enough alone. There are a few who aren't members of the Legion; I remember one in particular who was a member of the Mage's Guild in Balmora. Nice enough, for an Orc, but she had this strange fascination with bones ... Another I met in a local corner club threatened to take me out back and do bad things, because she thought I was staring at her. I most certainly was not, but apparently she thought she was a notorious outlaw and wanted everybody to know about it. If I was an outlaw, I would definitely not want to be notorious. Anyway, despite their appearance, most Orcs are fairly easy going. They want the same as everybody else, to be allowed to live their lives as they see fit; they're just more direct in demanding it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOutside of the cities, Orcs can be very dangerous, especially around shrines devoted to Malacath. Apparently if one happens by one of those shrines, the Orcs there feel they have to challenge you to see how strong you are. If you're like me and you want to keep your head, stay far away from any shrine, especially those with Orcs at the door! There are a few friendly Orcs who poke around the ruins, but it's best not to risk finding out the hard way which will invite you to dinner and which will try to have you for dinner. A good rule of thumb: if an Orc has a weapon out or their hands raised, they don't want you over for dinner, they want you for dinner. Stay away from shrines, as I do, and you should be fine.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA lot has been said about Orcish intelligence, most of it that they don't have much, which can't be further from the truth. In fact, Orcs can be very intelligent: while I'm not much good with a hammer myself, it takes more than instinct to know how to bend a piece of metal to one's will. Still, one must take care to be quite direct, when talking to an Orc; humor and sarcasm are lost on them. If they think you're trying to belittle them, they may react violently. Smash first and ask questions later seems to be their motto and they really love their motto.<BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nNot much has been said about Orcish cuisine because there's not much to say about it. They enjoy meat of all kinds: rat, hound, guar, kagouti, alit, and some less savory types. If it walks on two legs or four and is more likely to die than to kill the hunter, it's fair game. Orcs tend to not use many spices, instead preferring their meat right off the bone. They prefer it cooked, which makes it more palatable, but in a pinch, they'll skip that step. Orcs have been known to eat the occasional vegetable, usually raw and always with the intent to rid themselves of some digestive ailment, which, as you can imagine, are frequent. They wash down all of this meat with a number of local brews: mainly sujamma, shein and mazte. After seeing them eat for the first time, I needed some myself. While the Dunmer tend to be reserved in their eating habits, Orcs aren't; they eat with gusto and it's not seldom that one has to clean more than one's hands after a particularly engaging meal. If you are ever invited to dine with Orcs, bring a fresh change of clothes and plenty of toothpicks.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAll in all, Orcs are a very interesting race that can be a joy to interact with, provided one takes care around them. Even the most peaceful of Orcs can become rather testy if you mention hygiene, or his lack thereof, within earshot. Just stay upwind and nod your head to whatever they say. If they ask you to join them for dinner, it is best to politely decline and give a good excuse. A recent death in the family usually works because Orcs revere their kin and will almost certainly understand. Whatever you do, do not say that you're either going to a duel or are involved in one, because they will most certainly want to come and watch or participate; they may even want to challenge the winner! Go forth, good reader, and enjoy all that this race has to offer. Just keep your head while you're doing it.<BR>\r\n"

The land's unusual flora provide a wide range of local flavors not found elsewhere. The Dunmer have a marked preference for these local beverages, and imported wines, liquors, and beers are seldom seen in this region. Comberry is the signature fruit of Dunmer wines and brandies, as grapes do not grow locally. Wickwheat and saltrice are the staple grains in this region, forming the base of their liquors and beers. In this book, the most popular alcohols of the region will be covered, as well as Dunmer techniques of brewing and distillation.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Comberry Wine<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nComberry wine is known to fortify the endurance of the imbiber, but also tends to dull the mind. It is the single most popular table wine in Vvardenfell. It is inexpensive, and perhaps lacks the esteem of the finest Tamriel wines, but has a distinct flavor and local charm. This deep red wine is slightly tart and astringent, but in better quality varieties, this is balanced out by its rich sweetness, and even exhibits a slight hint of fruitiness.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nComberry grows in abundance in Vvardenfell, so it is more common here than imported grape wines. Comberry does not have the perfect combination of sugars, yeasts, and tannins for wine making, but they are a close second to grapes, needing only a little extra tending during the first fermentation.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBecause comberry contains more tannins than grapes, the stems are typically removed before crushing. The comberries are then crushed, and the skins are left in the vat to ferment with the juices, producing a heady wine with a deep red color, known locally as shein.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe yeast content present in comberry is not enough to complete fermentation, so a cultured yeast is added to the must. Sugars extracted from marshmarrow are also added to the must, as the comberry does not contain enough. During primary fermentation, a consistently warm temperature is required.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAfter the primary fermentation, the must is pressed, which separates the skins from the liquid. The wine is then placed in a cool place to stabilize before secondary fermentation is begun. The wine is aged in sealed wooden casks for several weeks or months, after which the wine is bottled and ready for consumption. Comberry wine typically has an alcohol content of about 12%.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Comberry Brandy<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nKnown locally as greef, comberry brandy is a distillate of comberry wine. It is known to fortify the strength of the imbiber, but tends to make one a little clumsy. Comberry wine benefits greatly from distillation, and its brandies are a much finer quality. Comberry brandy is smooth and clean tasting, with a hint of fruity sweetness.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo make this brandy, comberry wine is first selected, then boiled in a pot still, which is a type of large alembic. A diagram of this device is included at the end of this book. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wine, and the water is boiled off leaving a liquor with a higher alcohol content of about 30%. This is called low wine. This process is repeated to further distill the wine, after which the head is removed, which has an alcohol concentration of about 80%. This leaves the heart which is approximately 60% alcohol. The tail, the potion of low wine left over, is mixed into another batch for future use. The heart is then either bottled as common brandy, or aged in wooden casks to produce a finer brandy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCyrodiilic brandy is produced from the finest grapes of Cyrodiil, and is often imported into the province of Morrowind. Vintage brandy is a comberry brandy that has been cask aged for forty years or more. Ancient Dagoth brandy is another type of comberry brandy that is incredibly rare, as it was bottled during the First Era. It can still be found to this day, and is highly prized by connoisseurs.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Local Beers<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nMazte is a local ale made from saltrice. It fortifies the strength of the imbiber, but also dulls the mind and weakens the will. Mazte typically has a weak alcoholic content of about 4%, It is a deep red ale that is fairly sweet and malty. This local ale is inexpensive, and the most common beverage in the region.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn mazte production, saltrice grains are malted by soaking them until they begin to germinate, after which they are dried in a kiln. The roasting time will determine the ale's color, typically malted to produce a deep red. The malted grains are called grist, and mixed in hot water to produce the mash.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe mash is mixed in hot water for a couple of hours in a mash tun, a large keg with spigot fitted on the bottom. The wort, a sugary liquid, is separated from the grains through a process called lautering. The mash is first heated, then the wort is drawn off the bottom of the mash and added to the top to filter the liquid. Water is then passed through the mash to extract the last of the wort from the grains in a process called sparging.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe sweet wort is collected in a large kettle and boiled for an hour. Bittergreen is added at this time as a source of bitterness, flavor, and aroma. The wort is then cooled, and a cultivated top-fermenting yeast is added for the final fermentation. The brew is left in the fermenter for weeks or months until the yeast settles leaving a clear ale, after which the ale is bottled or casked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Whiskeys and other Distilled Liquors<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\r\nSujamma is the most common local liquor, greatly fortifying the imbiber's strength, but also greatly dulling the mind. This golden liquor packs quite a punch, but it has a smooth and pleasant taste with a slight peaty aroma. It is made from malted and fermented wickwheat, and has a typical alcoholic content of about 35%.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCyrodiilic whiskey is heavily imported into the province and is known locally as flin, fortifying both the imbiber's strength and will. It is distilled from fermented grain mash of either malted or unmalted barley. It is distilled in a pot still until it achieves an alcoholic strength of approximately 40%.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSujamma and whiskey are made by first malting the grains, then fermenting in a similar manner to beer. The malting process gives sujamma its distinct peaty flavor. It is roasted in kilns fueled by lichens which impart their flavor in the smoke. It is then fermented using a cultivated yeast to produce a wash, a type of sour beer. This wash is then is distilled in a pot still. The wash is heated in the pot still until the vapors pass over the neck of the still where it condenses into liquid. This is then passed through a second still. During the second distillation, only the heart, or middle cut, is collected and casked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMead, or honey wine, is a popular nord beverage. It is slowly gaining popularity in Vvardenfell since the East Empire Company started exporting it from the nearby island of Solstheim. Pure mead is made with a mixture of honey and water, which is then fermented with yeast, much like other wines. Unlike Yokudan mead, a tradition preserved by the Redguards, nordic mead is not boiled before fermenting. Leaving out this step in the process produces a cloudier beverage, but preserves its natural sweetness. Yokudan mead loses its sugars due to boiling, and must be aged for a minimum of twelve years to reduce its unwanted bitter aftertaste.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNords often drink mulled mead during their winter festivals. Mulled wines, of all varieties, are served warm and have local spices added. Another mead variant is called melomel, which is fermented with fruit to give it extra flavor. Melomel is not traditional to Solstheim, but an increase in trade with Vvardenfell has made comberries available on the island, so a new comberry melomel is slowly gaining popularity with Dunmer immigrants.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAll in all, the Dunmer have a rich cultural heritage, and these spirits are an integral part of that heritage. They are best experienced in the Dunmer heartland while traveling through the unique province that created them. You'll be hard pressed to find them elsewhere, as they are not often exported from their homeland. The tastes of Vvardenfell reflect a world set apart from the continent, and a rich wild land yet untamed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Pot Still<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"OAAB\\alembic_pot_still.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"><BR>"

In your travels, have you come across that magnificent race the Bretons? If not, you do not know what you are missing, my friend. We are an affable people, unlike the supercilious Altmer or the brusque Nords. A Breton would not think twice about inviting you to sit at his table and share his meal. And what a meal you would have! The food may be rustic, but that does not mean it is not good and fulfilling. I have yet to find another race that can grill nix-hound meat to such perfection. Where was I? Oh, yes, my kin folk, the Bretons.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBretons tend to be more slender than the bulky Nord or Orsimer (Orc to the uninitiated). But what we lack in size, we make up for in brains and natural ability. Yes, the Altmer claim to be masters of the metaphysical world, but one errant fireball and they light up like a brazier. A Breton’s natural resistance to magicka means that while we may be singed, we won’t be rolling on the ground trying fruitlessly to extinguish ourselves. I can attest from first-hand experience that watching a poor Altmer rolling around on the ground is not a pretty sight, nor one I would wish my worst enemy to see. Unless my worst enemy happens to be an Altmer, then I wish he were the one rolling. Be that as it may, I implore you, gentle reader, [deleted] do not set Altmers on fire merely to witness them rolling on the ground; let them do it to themselves, no matter how much enjoyment may be derived from such a spectacle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy kinfolk mostly worship the Nine Divines: Akatosh, Magnus, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth, Julianos, and Phynaster. Dibella deserves a special mention, what with her succulent comberries; her irresistible fire petals just waiting to unfold and share their sweet nectar; her…ahem. Where was I? Oh yes, the Divines. Yes, they are a very agreeable bunch and we very much like them; unlike those stuffy Daedra Princes the Dunmer worship or the “gods” of the Tribunal. Why, practically anybody can walk around proclaiming to be a god in their culture; except in Morrowind that is. Try doing that there and one will quickly find himself whisked away to the Ministry of Truth, never to be heard from again. Ministry of Truth, hah! Leave it to the dour Dunmer to think of such a name. No sense of humor, those people. Then again, having to breathe in the dust from Red Mountain would sour one’s mood quickly. I suggest you wear a scarf if visiting Vvardenfell. Better yet, don’t visit at all. Wouldn’t you rather go some place nice, like High Rock? Sure we Bretons have our feuds, but that’s what keeps the blood flowing! Though sometimes it flows where it shouldn’t, like outside of one’s body. Still, a pretty healer can help one [deleted] forget one’s pains.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSpeaking of healers, Breton women are the fairest to behold. Don’t believe me? Take a walk through High Rock, or visit the Mage’s Guild if you are so unfortunate as to find yourself in Vvardenfell. Better yet, just take my word for it, you won’t regret it. Did I mention nix-hound steaks? I would be remiss if I didn’t suggest that you try one cooked to perfection by a Breton chef!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf you are a frequent traveler of these fair lands, you have no doubt met many of my kinfolk. That’s because we Bretons are an adventurous lot; young Bretons love nothing more than seeing new places and meeting new people. Why, any one of us would gladly share our fire and ale with you should you but ask nicely. Don’t mistake that friendliness for weakness; however, for though we may appear slight, we are by no means frail and will defend ourselves to the death if necessary. Why I’ve even heard tales of naked Nords being left rooted in one spot because they attempted to partake of the charms of our women uninvited. Let this be a warning to you, gentle reader, Breton women are not to be trifled with. Not if you wish to retain your dignity, among other things.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnd there you are, gentle reader, the Bretons: a strong, proud people whose natural magicka resistance helps us become some of the premier wizards of Nirn. Sure Altmer may boast of their ability to cast spells repeatedly without rest, but wave a torch near them and they scream like babes before hiking up their skirts and running away. So if you are fortunate to meet one of my brethren with a hand extended in friendship, please take it; just be aware of the dagger in his belt; they are not for show and we will not hesitate to use them when required. We are a friendly lot, but we are not weak.<BR>"

Seven years before the fall of Orsinium due to the combined efforts of the armies of Daggerfall, Sentinel, and the Order of Diagna.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlmost all of this is in the first person, as Makela was unfamiliar with the protocols and scholarly formalities of recording herself into a memory stone. None the less, her heroism and heroic deeds live on, her memories fresh in the stone for all to feel and hear.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><BR><BR>\r\n* * *<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR><BR>\r\n\" .. . muuu uhh, I wonder if this will really work?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"The Mages guild took me for 25,000 gold crowns if it doesn't. Imagine? This stone will record my thoughts? What did they say? Just unwrap it from the silver foil and leather bag and as soon as it touches my flesh it will begin to record.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Ahhhh, the pain, I must block it out, no one would want to hold my stone and hear my thoughts if I let it record my pain. Thank the Ebonarm and the training I received in The Hall of the Virtues of War. I CAN block out this pain. Ummm just, ah, there, it's walled off.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Yes I can still see it there just beyond my consciousness lurking like a hungry wolf - a wolf that will soon consume me. I see also my inevitable death from these damned wounds. No potions left, the healing crystal and ring are used up, and me, with not even magic enough to light a candle. Oh but the gods did give me other gifts, the gift of sword singing, the thrill of battle, Frandar Hunding's Book of Circles, THE WAY OF THE SWORD. Ah but then that is my story, I get ahead of myself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI am Makela Leki a warrior, a sword-singer, a second level Ansei. In my cradle I could form the Shehai, the spirit sword - The mystical blade, mine formed of pure thought serpents intertwined with vines of roses to form the blade, as beautiful as ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAh, but I'm about to tell you all about that, to tell you my story, a story of valiant battle, of my loves, of my wars, of. of betrayal and of this last glorious victory. To tell you of how I came to this distant lonely pass me and five companions, to fight these men and monsters to defeat the army that would fall on my people like cowards in the night, but again I get ahead of myself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI am a simple warrior. I grew up as a Maiden of the Spirit Blade. As early as I can remember I wanted to be a Singer, to feel the hunger of the blade in my hands, to feel it come alive and take my enemies. I am told our people were artisans and poets long ago in our desert homes. Here in new home now known as Hammerfell, many of us have returned to those ancient ways, but to me there is but ONE WAY. THE WAY of the SWORD.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAh this is hard to tell. I grew up in my noble family, the only one of three brothers and two sisters that felt the calling, the Song of the Sword. Father understood, for he too had felt the call. He had become a master, and Ansei long before settling down with in our estate to raise a family. At eleven, I entered the Hall of the Virtues of War and joined the Maidens of the Spirit Sword. In my band there were six of us. Daring Julia, solid Patia, big Kati, svelte Cegila, wise Zell, and me - all are gone now, save me, and soon I will join them. ... Join them in the halls of the unknown gods of war.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe drank together, we fought, we wept, we grew in the way of the sword. We joined in our learnings in the Hall with our Brothers of the Blade. Learning from each other, we all sat at the feet of the Hall Master striving to learn the depths of the Shehai - making the spirit blade into a real weapon as Frandar Hunding had. Only a few have the purity of heart and virtue to be able to take the step and learn the mysteries of Ansei. Sword Sainthood.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSomehow, of all the Brothers and the Maidens, I only possessed the unique qualities, the faint but strong enough flicker of magicka to call forth the Shehai. Many times I called it, seldom would it become substantial enough to be a weapon. To be a Ansei of the first level you just need to be able to call it, and that I could, so I became the first Ansei from our local hall in two generations.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOh I have so much to tell, so many memories, so many treasures to share with you, my unknown companion. How do I start?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nUmhhh, the pain is still out there lurking hungry, slowly consuming what's left of me. I guess I had better tell of the final battle, the one that has left me here, and then if I have the will left tell you of my life, of my love Raliph. Oh what a lad he was. What times we shared ... Ebonarm ... Forgive me, my mind wanders ... Let me go to the Final Battle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nUmm to start, in the middle humm. Yes. We Maidens grew, learned, mastered the Way, and upon completing the Walk-About. To you who are not Singers, this is a wilderness trek emulating the times of Frandar Hunding - where we each wander the country side righting wrongs, defeating monsters, performing quests in the name of virtue. Some of us in our Hall took years to finish. Always there is danger, we six Maidens each returned in our own good time, but many are they who do not live to return from the Walk About.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe returned, each to our own lives, to meet in the hall once a week to tell our stories to the new Maidens and Brothers, and to perform as instructors in the Way of the sword. All was well till the night of the MidYear Festival.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAll our people were reveling and ... excuse ... enjoying the repast, but for we six Maidens. It happened that the festival day fell on our day of meeting in the hall, our day of prayer and fasting and honor to the Way of the Sword.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs we met, late into the night, a knocking rang on our door. When I opened, it there was a guardian the Bankorai Pass in the Wrothgarian Mountains, wounded and near death ... He told us of betrayal from the north, an invasion sponsored by the Crystal Tower of High Rock, led by King Joile of Daggerfall -- our ally in the war with Orsinium!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nQuickly we used up a crystal of healing in restoring him to vitality. We sent him on to the king, while we six grabbed our weapons and armor of power, and as many potions, marks, and crystals and rings as we could carry.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe flew to the pass hoping upon hope that we would not be too late. Our journey was not in vain, for we arrived just at the very point where the last three guardians were overwhelmed by the horde. Into the pass we ran forming the old battle line, six abreast.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOh did we FIGHT.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Song of the Sword was a joyous noise slicing through the ranks of evil. We fought for hours. Julia was the first to fall, a cowardly poisoned dagger finding a rent in her armor. Then one by one all fell, save me.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n... oh cruel Ebonarm ... Then my beloved sword, the sword of my father, the one with the serpent's crest, fashioned by the master sword smith Singer Tansal broke in my hands. All was lost, our six lives spent in vain. Now, many many of them would pour through the pass. I would be easy prey for them, like a newborn child. I wept in frustration.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThen I remembered the hearth in our home - the book. Frandar Hunding's Book of Circles, the Way of Strategy. I reached for the Shehai the spirit sword, that which I could never reliably form when I needed it, and behold ... it was alive. Alive with fire. It formed in my hand. Ablaze with power ---<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOh I slew mightily, right and left, like a scythe through wheat. All the way to the Lord of the Tower I fought. With one blow I cut his magical armor asunder, one more took his head.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBut to do that deed cost me dearly, wounds by the dozen, for although I had magical armor, it was not formed of spirit like my blade, it was not as invincible as my blade or my own spirit, and I was sorely wounded.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWith the felling of King Joile, his army crumbled. They fled before my wrath. All ran back through the pass not even pausing to collect their dead and wounded. All who could stand ran for their lives, and I slew all I could reach, but my breath was coming short, and the pain ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFinally I rested, on this rock where you find me now. I don't know why I chanced to bring this stone along. I bought it on a whim really, with the loot from ... ah well I guess I need to really stop and tell my story in order. I feel able to go on to tell you more ... the eternal night is descending more slowly than I thought.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNot just yet, am I ready to compose my death poem. A little sip of water and ... well I think I will go back and tell you of my life, maybe some details about the battle. And Oh yes. About Raliph and our children, humm where will I start.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n... oh ... rrr ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI am ... a simple warrior ... I grew up as a, a Maiden of the Spirit Blade ... As early ... as early as I can ... remember ...<BR>\r\n<BR>"

The tales of their mischief are found in every culture, in most every village, town, and city-states in the Empire. Alternately they are called Faerie, Fey, Illyadi, Sprites, Pixies, and Sylphim, and their natures seem to flit from one story to the next with the same variation. It could almost be said that Faeries are anything unpredictable in nature.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe noted scholar Ahrtabazus studying at the time in the Crystal Tower of Sumurset Isle developed an interesting if controversial theory about Faerie. He organized the Fey variants on a chain, beginning with the glimmering sparks called Pixies or Whilloki by the Redguards at one end and the godlike beings such as Gheateus, Chonus, and Sygria at the other. In the middle are human and semi-human beings generating up to intelligent trees, brooks, rocks, even mountains. All of this was a new and completely original theory and would have prompted enthusiastic, if somewhat skeptical response had Ahrtabazus not added this footnote: \"It may be that elves as a whole are part of this chain, above whilloki and below nephrine. They certainly have similar features and propensities for magicka as the other Faerie.\" (Ahrtabazus, \"The Faerie Chain\" Firsthold, 2E 456)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNo elf liked to be put in a hierarchy slightly above whimsical pranksters like the whilloki, and Ahrtabazus was challenged on his assumptions based on very slight coincidences. Nevertheless, with modification, his Fairie Chain theory has gained wider and wider acceptance since its publication.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe hierarchial chain is not, in the strictest sense, an order of command. While Gheateus and Sygria are said to be surrounded by a host of minor Sylphim, faerie on the whole are not followers nor leaders. Their plans and schemes are not governed by a higher purpose, simply by their own whim.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo this most faerie scholars agree. Because it is based on coincidental evidence and supported by auxiliary theories, it may very well be wrong.<BR>\r\n<BR>"

      "text": "<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\r\nA Scholar's Guide to Nymphs<BR>\r\nby Vondham Barres<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI grew up a scholar, an ascetic devoted to knowledge, with eyes that saw beauty in a fascinating passage in a dusty tome, love in the candle that allowed me to study on starless nights, passion in a well-reasoned argument of a long dead issue. I was a student who never graduated and was never expelled.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough I am not defending myself, I should further define myself. I am not what you would call a prude. In fact, I can speak of subjects in a detached way that would make the most debauched strumpet in Skyhawk blush with discovered modesty. I wrote an essay on the House of Dibella as a scholar should, analysing the cult of beauty and physical relations as one might study crop rotation or the digestive system of an orc. The acquaintances of mine who were inclined to wink and giggle I tolerated, but barely.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWith all that said, the reader will understand that when I decided to study the language of the nymphs in order to study their character and culture, it was not a decision I made on account of prurience or lust. Scholars have historically neglected the nymph as a subject worthy of research, and this neglect I attribute to prejudice. The sages with whom I have spoken on the subject have eloquently and intelligently formed sentences which, boiled down, can be translated as: \"Nymphs look like beautiful, naked women who skip along tra-la-la and like to have indisciminate sex. What could they have to say that would be of any interest?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSo here I was faced with the most daunting of projects -- to study and research a species unstudied is a potentially rewarding challenge. If the subject was unstudied because the scientific community had deemed it beneath interest, a potentially rewarding but decidedly frustrating challenge. If I spent months in serious study of their language and culture and additional time in their company, and discovered nothing more than that the common prejudice is correct, the term \"laughing stock\" would not do me justice.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSo, excited and nervous for reasons unrelated to the notoriously promiscuous behavior of my subjects, I began my studies. I mastered the language, a melodious tongue that sounds like wild elf and faerie but share no vocabulary with them. I studied the lore, and found it to be on the whole, little more than pornography and crude conjecture.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI next had to find a nymph.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFrom my centralized location in the Imperial City, I found it easy to send word around to several well known temples and guilds devoted to study in all the provinces. Not all replies back were serious in nature, but one, from the School of Julianos in Sentinel helped me considerably. To Magister Oitos and his disciples, I here offer my sincere gratitude.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNymphs are extremely shy creatures, no matter what the more obscene stories will tell you. No one who I've spoken with has had one seek him or her out. Thus to speak with a nymph requires energy and patience.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOut of courtesy for her privacy, I will not here give the location of the little grotto off the coast of Hammerfell where I found the nymph. It took three months of patient waiting, leaving presents where I knew the nymph would be, before the nymph stood still at my approach.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI remember I was carrying a bouquet of purple and white tetias, and she looked at them and then at me, and smiled. The effect of her smile was truly magical, I'm convinced. Her body was, of course, perfect; her face lovely and serene; her hair like silk flame. But until she smiled, she was beautiful in the abstract, a perfect statue by a master. The smile made her approachable and, thus, terrifying.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"For you,\" I said, attempting my first utterance of Nymph to a real nymph.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHer smile grew into a grin which became a giggle and then a laugh. The reader has doubtless heard of the silver laughter of the elves. The nymph's laugh is earthy and spontaneous, and very ... suggestive.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"And what do you want from me in return, mortal?\" she asked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I am,\" There is no, I should say, known word in the Nymph language for scholar, \"I am a man who likes to learn things. I want to learn things about you.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnd I did.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNymphs are the wisest, most wonderful creatures in Tamriel. My nymph, her name is Ayalea (a poor phonetic transcription of a word that sounds more like a light wind blowing through a small crack in a hollow chamber) and she knows more about the behavior and varieties of the deep woodland creatures than the greatest wood elf scholar I ever met. She taught me of flowers and ghosts and creatures too fast and timid to have ever been seen by man.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAyalea taught me how to learn for the very first time. How to open my mind to all of the possibilities of life and how to use that knowledge, not just to hold in my cramped brain like a dragon's horde.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf you ever meet a nymph, speak to her.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER \"><BR><BR>\r\n* * *<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT \"><BR><BR>\r\nEditor's note: the writer Vondham Barres is no longer a scholar at the Imperial University.

But on that sunny night on the 5th of First Seed, I didn't want an adult. I wanted Hermaeus Mora, the daedra of knowledge, learning, gums, and varnishes. You see, I was told by a beautiful, large breasted man who lived under the library in my home town that the 5th of First Seed was Hermaeus Mora's night. And if I wanted the Oghma Infinium, the book of knowledge, I had to summon him.

The only thing that made me somewhat suspicious was Hermaeus Mora, from what I read, was a big blobby multi-eyed clawed monstrosity, and this guy looked like a waistcoated banker.

He fought agains the Akaviri slavetraders and single-handedly slew hundreds. Despite his valor, Lyrisius' army was routed and scattered to the four winds. Lyrisius fled into the moors to escape the Akaviri chariots.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFar from the lands of men, Lyrisius entered the blasted lands. At the heart of this forsaken landscape, he met the wyrm. The great scaly beast mocked the mighty blows of Lyrisius' enchanted spear. It melted the shield Fearstruck, gift of the Daedra Boethiah, with a single blast of its fiery breath. Lyrisius, seeing that he could not defeat the creature by force of arms, surrendered.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe wyrm intended to devour Lyrisius when the hero offered to be its slave and manservant. Ever prideful, the wyrm agreed. Seeing that the wyrm was vulnerable to conceit, Lyrisius spoke, \"Oh great wyrm. For my first service, I beg that you allow me to polish your one tarnished scale.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIndeed, centered between the great wings of the creature was a dull scale, clearly out of reach of its long neck. Its vanity was such that it immediately lowered one wing for Lyrisius to climb upon.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnce astride the great lizard, Lyrisius slid his dagger underneath the scale and into the tender flesh of the beast. Though it spun and twisted in all directions, the wyrm could not get at the hero. Finally it took to the air. Lyrisius clung to the neck with all his strength as the wyrm banked, rolled, and dove.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSeeing that Lyrisius could not be shaken free, the wyrm demanded that he remove the stinging blade. Lyrisius answered, \"Fly straight on until you see a great army. Destroy that army and I will remove my blade.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWith a great roar, the scaled creature set off. The Akavari army had no chance against the fire-breathing beast. They have never plagued Tamriel since.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I have done as you bid. Now sheath your stinger,\" roared the wyrm.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKnowing that he would be devoured or worse, Lyrisius pulled the blade and then leapt from the back of the flying wyrm. Indeed, the foul monster had intended to slay the hero. The wyrm pursued the plummeting Lyrisius. Boethiah appeared beside the falling hero. Praising him for ultimately destroying the army of Akavir, she turned him into a raven. Lyrisius quickly lost the wyrm in the clouds.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLegend has it that the wyrm still lives, though this happened in the first era long, long ago. The dragon nurses a grudge against Lyrisius and all of his kind. It has vowed never again to trust two legged bearers of weapons.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER \"><BR><BR>\r\n* * *<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT \"><BR><BR>\r\nScholar's Note: If this legend has a basis in fact, the artifact Fearstruck was utterly destroyed.

Rheumy eyes lost their focus as they gazed out over the sun-warmed valley in the mountains of High Rock. For a moment he saw a vision of ancient horrors instead of the fresh greenery of spring. A chill washed over his aged bones.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Is this a suitable topic for the young and innocent?\" he asked himself. The young must be taught, but must they learn of such things now, when they should be playing in the sunlight? This is a tale for the dreary winter, with the wind howling outside a walled town and the doors and windows closed and bolted against the blast and cold and -- other things.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe glanced with affection at his two grandchildren: the little towheaded boy with a hint of mischief dancing in his eyes even on those rare occasions when sitting quietly, and his older sister. A serene lass, the old man thought. Her hair like a dark flame and her slightly pointed ears were the only obvious signs of elven blood. So like her grandmother, the old man thought. The past is past, and I'shira had brought him so much peace and happiness after a lifetime of battle. He forced his thoughts back to the present.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Sorry, children. I was remembering things. Old people do that, you know.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Are you going to tell us the story of Jagar Tharn and the Emperor and the Eternal Champion?\" His grandson asked. \"That's my favorite!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Not exactly, son. They were a part of it, in a way. As are I'ric and Moraelyn and Edward and Reymon and many others. Even the gods play a part. This is a far older story, and even the priests won't tell it my way. They have their own interpretations, and their fears as well. I'm too old and have seen too much to have any fear left, except that our people will forget. And forgetting is dangerous. So I, and a few others, carry this tale and try to spread it among the younger generations. You aren't really old enough to understand it all, but I can feel that my end is not far off. I must ask you to remember anyway. In a few years, perhaps, if I still live, we can discuss it again. If not, well, you must seek out others who know, and compare notes.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"You talk as if you are going to die, Granther,\" his granddaughter spoke up. \"That can't happen. You will live forever!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nChuckling, \"I'm afraid not, dear. But I have a little while left, enough for the story\".<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe children settled back against the bole of a large oak, knowing that the old man could not be hurried. Leaning forward, he began:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Long, long ago, before there were any people at all; even before the gods, Tamriel was chosen as a battleground by two -- things. It is difficult to find words that fit them well. I call them the Light and the Dark. Others use different names. Good and Evil, Bird and Serpent, Order and Chaos. None of these names really apply. It suffices that they are opposites, and totally antithetical. Neither is really good or evil, as we know the words. They are immortal since they do not really live, but they do exist. Even the gods and their daedric enemies are pale reflections of the eternal conflict between them. It's as though their struggle creates energies that distort their surroundings, and those energies are so powerful that life can appear, like an eddy in a stream.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Do demons and trolls come from the Dark, Grandpa?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Not exactly, son. The undead evils we know, and the demons that live on Oblivion tend to align with the Dark. Their natures are more akin to it. Humans and the other peoples of Tamriel, even the misunderstood Dark Elves, are more aligned with the Light. Our evils are not always of the Dark, but some are, and these are the truly dangerous ones. Jagar Tharn was almost wholly aligned with the Dark, and that is really why he was so monstrous. It was not because he was a black mage, as some would have it.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Did his magic come from the Dark, Granther?\" The girl's interest was piqued by mention of magic. Her heritage is beginning to show itself, thought the old man.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"No, magic power comes directly from the energies swirling about both entities. These energies are impersonal and all mixed up. Black magic is more a matter of intent than effect. The Mages' Guild holds that a fireball, say, directed against a creature intent on causing harm, is not black magic; but the same spell directed at one seeking peace is. In this, they are right. Destruction of a fire daedra strengthens the Light and weakens the Dark just a little. In the same manner, destruction of a unicorn strengthens the Dark.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"What about the gods? Do they come from the Light?\" The boy's eyes were animated, but tinged with apprehension. He adored stories of the gods and goddesses of Tamriel's pantheon, and the heroes who served them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe old man chuckled. \"The gods have an unusual origin, if some of the oldest tales are true. The oldest inhabitants of this world -- no one seems to be sure what race they were -- had a system of myths that they believed in for a thousand years. The people of et'Ada believed for so long and so well, that their beliefs may, just may, have drawn upon the energies surrounding Tamriel to bring the gods themselves into being. If that is so, the conflict between the Light and the Dark provided the energy, and the et'Adans the structure, that created the gods of Tamriel. No one really knows since it was so long ago and so little survives from that time. It no longer matters; the gods have their own existence now, and mostly align with the Light, except for a few who are, shall we say, a little ambiguous.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Why do we have to remember, Granther? What is the danger you spoke of? If the Light and Dark are so big and powerful, can we influence them? Should we try? What should we fight for?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I see that your critical faculties are developing, Solara. That is good. The answer is simple, but quite large enough for mere mortals like us. The Light and Dark are evenly matched, and perhaps will never resolve their conflict. Mortals and the beings of the Aetherius sometimes can perceive traces of them. Therein lies the danger; to most of us the Light is more congenial, even inspiring, and moves us to behavior that we would call good. To creatures like us, the Dark is -- horrible. Those who have visions of it are often driven mad, and the ones who are not would be better dead. The Dark is to us a monstrous emptiness, an emptiness that sucks the soul toward it -- to be twisted, maimed, and ultimately destroyed. What we can see of it seems utterly evil. Perhaps somewhere else this would not be so, but in our world, it is.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe old man paused to gather his thoughts, gazing once more at the fresh new life of spring.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"What we must do is never to forget that the Dark is always there, beckoning to the weak-souled among us. Should it gain ascendancy over Tamriel, through agents perverted by its awful attraction, terrible things could happen. All that we hold beautiful or desirable, even love itself, would be swept away. Peace and hope would be no more. For Tamriel, that would be the worst possible disaster. What I saw during Jagar's reign nearly killed me, almost destroyed my mind. When he was destroyed, I thought the worst was over, but it was not. The forces of the Dark are on the march again, and new heroes must rise to join the Eternal Champion in the fight against them.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe old man and the two children sat in silence for several minutes. Finally, the children assisted their grandfather to his feet, and they walked slowly away. Toward home, and hearth, and lunch.<BR>\r\n<BR>"

The discoverer was a nomad wanderer somewhere on the shores of Lake Vread in the Province of Elswyer. I can neither vouch for nor deny its authenticity or veracity - only that the scrolls, as such, DO exist. Read and judge for yourself:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBaan Dar, The Legend... Thief, Warlock, ShadowMaster, Ruthless Assassin, Undying Avenger, Dark God, Robber Baron, MasterMind of Nefarious Plots. All these things and more are the Legendary Baan Dar, he who is called The Bandit God. But what is the Truth?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBaan Dar, The Man is a much more simple and complex being. I pen this tale as I slowly die of old age and a mortifying arrow wound. I cannot decide if the truth will add to or subtract from the legend that is Baan Dar, nor if the original Baan Dar would want the truth to be known. Therefore, I will leave this tale hidden when I am done and gone, and let Fate (which was ever Baan Dar's true master and motivator) decide.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI was a child of 12 Seasons when I first met Baan Dar. Orphan of a Slaver raid during one of the many inter-provincial border wars. Living by my quick wits, nimble fingers, and the grace of Lady Luck in the back alleys and byways of my birth city. I had just \"liberated\" a loaf of bread and a few small apples from a local street vendor in the Bazaar on the edge of the city near the tumbled outer wall, and had withdrawn down an ill-lit alley to feast on my bounty when I was beset by an older band of my ilk. The older and lazier variety which were want to engage in the easier and less dangerous art of stealing from the stealers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere were 5 of the bully boys who had decided they were more deserving of my booty than I, and they were beating me half to death with staves in between bites and laughter at the time. Lying on the ground curled up into as tight a ball as I could manage, trying to protect my head and groin, I heard a quiet voice ask if they were not \"more suited to go down to the wharf and take food from your brother rats, or would you care to try your tricks on game a bit more your size and number?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSince my \"companions\" had become otherwise engaged with the newcomer and had for the nonce ceased thumping, kicking and cuffing at me, I looked up to see a dark shadow of boots, cloak, and chainmail hood leaning against the wall at the end of the alleyway.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe others, being what they were, took this as a challenge to their manhood - and easy prey to their superior number with a promise of coin of the realm as added reward (else the first part would have been overlooked). The leader of my band of playmates suggested that the stranger take a leap off the mentioned wharf unless he wished to join me there when they were done with their evening meal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHaving drawn chuckles and courage from his underlings, he then proceeded forward with staff at high port. I'm not quite sure exactly what followed, but within a short space of time, Lead Bully was lying in the dirt with a thrown dagger in his chest, number two bully had lost three teeth to a boot (I still carry them in a leather pouch as a keepsake), and number three bully was brought short by his own staff applied forcefully up between his toes (the two big ones!). Bullies four and five thought better of the entertainment and departed rapidly for parts unknown.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBaan Dar picked me up, dusted me off, and dragged me round to a near tavern where we shared a meal and a mug. I attempted to thank him for saving my life. How can I ever repay this favor, I asked? His reply was short, to the point, and has driven my actions in life ever since...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"THE PROPER WAY TO REPAY A FAVOR, IS NOT TO - PASS IT ON INSTEAD.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThings having not progressed well along the lines of health, wealth and welfare for me until that point in my life came upon a sudden change that night. I later learned (along with MANY other things) that Baan Dar had decided to take a direct and immediate interest in me because my situation reminded him very much of the bad start his own life had taken, and the odds he had faced to survive it. On that night he took me under his wing as a kind of apprentice. He saw to it that I learned weaponcraft and stealth, that I learned to read and write! He took me along when he traveled for the next year. I served as messenger, valet, packmule, lookout, cook - many things. I saw other towns, cities, races, provinces, and broadened my view and knowledge of the world far beyond belief. He taught me both morals and coldhearted ruthlessness - and when and how to apply each as the ethics of the situation required.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt the end of the year, he gave me good dagger, and decent horse, the 3 teeth, and leave (nay, Command) to make my own way in the world from that day forward - but to remember all I had been given, and to attempt to pass such a gift to another when and where I should find need and opportunity. That I have done, several times... as I assume he has also, and as I hope my various charges have after me (and they theirs).<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThus has the Legendary Baan Dar been seen time and again in various lands of our world at numerous and the same times in days of need. Thus also is the description so very hard to obtain and track - for in truth, there have been, and continue to be, many Baan Dars in the world. The most valuable lesson he ever taught me was that \"for Evil to triumph required not so much that many bad men to do wrong, as for One good man to fail to do what was right.\" We only hope that our combined and concatenated efforts have produced enough single men and women that will not fail to do the right thing, regardless of current local, morals, laws, religion, creed, or lure of coin of the realm.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Legend grows still. Of the Dark Avenging Blade on the Wings of Night that make no sound. The Patron Saint of the Lone Wolf. The Thousand Eyes and Ears, the Hundred Arms direspectful of Time or Distance. Undying, Master of Disguise, Man of a Thousand Faces, Shapes and Sizes, Gentle, Rough-Edged, Gay, Stern. All the Mystery of the \"Man Unknown and Undying\"... not a single man nor God at all, but a string of seeds sown upon the land and left to grow into a forest. How to reconcile this truth with the tales of cruelty and the gangs of \"Baan Dars\" or \"Bandits\"? Some are jealous Thieves who take the name only for the cloak of mystery and hope of hiding in it's Shadow. Others are tales twisted to reverse by those justly served by Baan Dar's unfettered by technicalities of law and custom. Some are backsliders drawn of the true path by temptation and returning to their old ways. Many are the things that any one Baan Dar cannot answer for, as others did the deeds in the same name. Some are tales of fishwives, made up to scare the child into doing what is wanted. Some are left as part of the \"Mystery\" that is both cloak and shield to the hidden purposes - a case where the fear of the tale serves to save the need of arms or action.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBut, by and large, the true Baan Dar is a string of beings taught to act upon what they believe in, and stand to take the yoke of needed action upon their own shoulders.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDon't fight if you can avoid blood or war, But if you must make War, do so with all your Heart and Might. Leave it at Threats if Threats be enough - but never make threats you are unwilling to carry to conclusion if required. Use all the arts at hand. But ever keep the true purpose in mind. Stand Tall, but never forget how to bend your knee to help another.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNote:<BR>\r\nThe rest of the scrolls are tales and tellings of various parts of the Legend, some as passed from Bard to Bard, some as the true tales underlying the Ballads. These fragments are still to be translated and debated. This fragment, however, contains the kernel of the Revelation and the true source of the questions surrounding the Baan Dar Legend. What Say You, Reader? For myself, I do not know... but God or unrelated string of linked souls as laid out here... I do know that Baan Dar IS a force in our Land and Lives, and one that gives Hope to many that need it, and pause to many I despise.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n- Arkan, Scribe of Daggerfall in the year 2E24<BR>\r\n<BR>"

Weltan is a Redguard poet whose verse I had read, but only in translation. He chooses to write in the old language of the Redguards, not in Tamrielic. I once asked him why.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"The Tamrielic word for the divinely rich child of rot, silky, pressed sour milk is ... cheese,\" said Weltan, a huge smile spreading like a tide over his lampblack face. \"The Old Redguard word for it is mluo. Tell me, if you were a poet fluent in both languages, which word would you use?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI am a child of the cities, and I would tell him tales of the noise and corruption, wild nights and energy, culture and decadence. He listened with awed appreciation of the city of my birth: white-marbled Imperial City where all the citizenry are convinced of their importance because of the proximity of the Emperor and the lustration of the streets. They say that a beggar on the boulevards of the Imperial City is a man living in a palace. Over spiced ale, I regaled Weltan with descriptions of the swarming marketplace of Riverhold; of dark, brooding Mournhold; of the mold-encrusted villas of Lilmoth; the wonderful, dangerous alleys of Helstrom; the stately avenues of grand old Solitude. For all this, he marvelled, inquired, and commented.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I feel as if I know your home, the Alik'r Desert, from your poems even though I've never been there.\" I told him.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Oh, but you don't. No poem can express the Alik'r. It may prepare you for a visit far better than the best guide book can. But if you want to know Tamriel and be a true citizen of the planet, you must go and feel the desert yourself.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt took me a little over a year to break off engagements, save money (my greatest challenge), and leave the urban life for the Alik'r Desert. I brought several books of Weltan's poems as my travel guide.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"A sacred flame rises above the fire, The ghosts of great men and women without names, Cities long dead rise and fall in the flame, The Dioscori Song of Revelation, Bursting walls and deathless rock, Fiery sand that heals and destroys.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese first six lines from my friend's \"On the Immortality of Dust\" prepared me for my first image of the Alik'r Desert, though they hardly do it justice. My poor pen cannot duplicate the severity, grandeur, ephemera and permanence of the Alik'r.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAll the principalities and boundaries the nations have placed on the land dissolve under the moving sand in the desert. I could never tell if I was in Antiphyllos or Bergama, and few of the inhabitants could tell me. For them, and so it came to me, we were simply in the Alik'r. No. We are part of the Alik'r. That is closer to the philosophy of the desert people.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI saw the sacred flame of which Weltan wrote on my first morning in the desert: a vast, red mist that seemed to come from the deep mystery of Tamriel. Long before the noon sun, the mist had disappeared. Then I saw the cities of Weltan. The ruins of the Alik'r rise from the sand by one blast of the unbounded wind and are covered by the next. Nothing in the desert lasts, but nothing dies forever.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt daylight, I hid myself in tents, and thought about the central character of the Redguards that would cause them to adopt this savage, eternal land. They are warriors by nature. As a group, there are none better. Nothing for them has worth unless they have struggled for it. No one fought them for the desert, but the Alik'r is a great foe. The battle goes on. It is a war without rancor, a holy war in the sense the phrase should always imply.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBy night, I could contemplate the land itself in its relative serenity. But the serenity was superficial. The stones themselves burned with a heat and a light that comes not from the sun, nor the moons Jone and Jode. The power of the stones comes from the beat of the heart of Tamriel itself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTwo years I spent in the Alik'r.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs write this, I am back in Sentinel. We are at war with the kingdom of Daggerfall for the possession of a grass-covered rock that belongs to the water of the Iliac Bay. All my fellow poets, writers, and artists are despondent for the greed and pride that brought these people into battle. It is a low point, a tragedy. In the words of Old Redguard, an ajcea, a spiral down.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYet, I cannot be sorrowful. In the years I spent in the glories of the Alik'r, I have seen the eternal stones that live on while men go dead. I have found my inner eye in the tractless, formless, changeless and changeable land. Inspiration and hope, like the stones of the desert, are eternal though men be not.<BR>\r\n<BR>"

To indulge his hobby he became an avid collector of books on almost any subject he could find in print.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOne day he stumbled across a tome which purported to tell the secrets of life, death, and the purpose of existence. After months of studying the convoluted logic, written in opaque language, he thought that he was finally beginning to understand what the author was saying.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDuring this time he became so intent on understanding the book that he ignored everything else: his business started to slide towards bankruptcy, his few friends stopped visiting him, he ignored the plague which was ravaging the town, and his family were ready to leave him.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nJust as he felt that the book was opening visions of new worlds, the plague brought him low. His family tended his illness out of a sense of duty, but he slowly sank towards death. So, as a last resort, he prayed to Mara the mother-goddess to allow him enough time to complete his studies of the book.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Why should I make an exception for you, Ark`ay?\" asked Mara.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Mother Mara, I am finally beginning to understand this book and the meaning of life and death\" he answered, \"and with a little more time to study and think, I should be able to teach others\".<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Hmmm, it sounds to me like that `teaching others' is an afterthought to appeal to me\", she replied. \"What is the reason for death and birth?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"There are far more souls in the Universe than there is room for in the physical world. But it is in the physical world that a soul has an opportunity to learn and progress. Without birth, souls would not be able to acquire that experience, and without death there would be no room for birth.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Not a very good explanation, but it does have elements of truth. Maybe with more study you could improve it,\" she mused. \"I cannot give you `a little more time.' I can only condemn you to Eternal labor in the field you have chosen. How say you to that?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I do not understand, mother,\" said Ark'ay.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Your choice is to either accept the death that is so close or to become a god with us. But a god is not an easy nor pleasant thing to be. As the god of death and birth you will spend eternity making sure that deaths and births stay in proper balance in the physical world. And, in spite of what you believe you understand, you will always agonize over whether your decisions are truly correct. How do you decide?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nArk'ay spent what seemed to him as an eternity in thought before answering. \"Mother, if my studies are not completely wrong, my only choice is to accept the burden and try to transmit the reasons for death and birth to humanity.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"So be it, Arkay, God of Birth and Death.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>"

They played together, and ran through the woods together, exploring their little world and learning to see things through each other's eyes. This was very different from their parents because Shandar was the son of Maldor, who was captured in a war and forced to work as a slave for the village baron. Their village and another both needed the land between them to feed the villagers, and fought and fought, until many of the villagers died. Maldor was wounded in battle, and left for dead by his fellows. He was captured and forced to work in the fields as punishment. Shandar was not allowed to play with Mara, but she was very small and the other children didn't like to play with her, so she played with Shandar against her father's command. And they learned that they were really not very different at all. They couldn't understand why their parents hated each other so.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWell, Shandar and Mara played together for many years, and learned to love each other as they grew up. They knew that they couldn't let their parents know, because it was forbidden for them ever to marry, since they were from different villages and the war was still going on. They tried and tried to figure out how they could be happy together, and finally decided that they must run away from their village. They would try to make a new life for themselves in another village, far, far away from where they grew up.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOne night, while planning their escape, they were discovered by the town guards. Shandar tried to fight them, but they tied him up and dragged him away to the prison inside town. Mara was taken home, and her father was very angry with her, and told her that she could not leave their home again. He went to the house of another farmer, and asked if their son would marry Mara, so that she could never see Shandar again. The marriage was planned for the next week.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShandar, meanwhile, was to be killed for daring to be with Mara. He was beaten, and placed in a stockade. He was placed in a stockade, and they were to hang him the next day. When Mara found out that Shandar was to be killed, she knew that she could never live without him, and climbed out her window and ran into the woods, crying and crying. She ran and ran, and soon was lost. It was very dark, because back then they did not have any moons in the sky back then to make it safe for little boys and girls. Soon she found herself in a part of the woods she had never been before, and sat down on a rock since she was very tired.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWell, the rock was a secret entrance to a cave where a very mean orc lived. When he came back from his hunting, he found Mara curled up asleep on his rock, and thought to himself, \"Hmmm, a tasty little girl. I shall save her for my breakfast!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe grabbed her and took her into his cave, moving the rock back so that she could not escape. She was sure to die, and tried to escape, but the evil orc just laughed and laughed at her, until she finally gave up.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen the villagers found out that Mara had run off, they were very worried. No one knew the woods very well, and all were afraid of the evil orc that lived there. Only Shandar was not afraid, and he begged and begged for the baron to set him free, so that he could go look for Mara. The Baron finally decided to let Shandar go, for no one else was brave enough to go and rescue Mara. So Shandar was set free, and he set off into the woods to go and rescue her.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShandar searched and searched, but could not find poor Mara. Finally, he sat down on a rock to rest for a moment, and as he sat down, he noticed a piece of cloth under the rock. It was a piece from Mara's cloak! He realized that she must be under the rock somehow, and knew that the orc had captured her. He pushed and pushed on the rock, and finally was able to roll it aside. He climbed down into the orc's cave, but it was very dark, and he could not see anything. The evil orc, when he heard his front door moving, hid in the shadows to see what was coming into his home. When he saw that it was just a little man-boy, he grinned to himself and thought, \"Now I have lunch, TOO!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen Shandar came near, the orc grabbed him, and began to squeeze the life out of him.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBack in the village, the people soon realized that they were foolish to let a young man go off into the woods by himself. They gathered all of their weapons, and set off to find the two lost children. When they finally came upon the clearing near the orcs' cave, they saw a strange and wondrous sight: A slain orc near the entrance to the cave, and Mara holding the head of poor Shandar in her lap. Shandar had killed the orc, but not before the it gave Shandar a mortal wound.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMara's tears flowed freely from her eyes and splashed upon Shandar's face, reflecting the light from the villager's torches. Shandar was filled with sorrow at the thought that he had saved Mara, only to lose her because of his own impending death from the battle with the orc. He cried out to Mara's namesake, the goddess of love, to help them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Goddess Mara recognized their true love and wept at their loss. Not having power over death, she could do nothing to save Shandar, but she knew that she could not let their love die. She reached down from the heavens and picked up Mara and Shandar in her arms, and placed them high in the heavens. They could be together always, and provide light in the dark night to others so that they may be safe from the evils in the world. The villagers were amazed at this sight, and vowed to honor the love of Shandar and Mara by learning more about themselves and their neighbors, so that the war that had been going on as long as anyone could remember would end. Shandar's sacrifice for the one he loved showed them that he was worthy of their respect, and that those from his village were just as proud and worthy as themselves.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnd, that's why, children, every night we can see Mara's Tear and Shandar's Sorrow spending their lives together high in the heavens, lighting the way for all the little boys and girls like you.<BR>\r\n<BR>"

Jephre gave heed to the nature of the forests and delighted in the gurgling streams and brooks. It was Jephre who taught the birds to sing their songs of the seasons and He that taught the streams the tinkling ethereal tune. The very trees are said to have moved close to hear him sing on the warm summer nights of those elder days. It was in this time that the first great ballads of the elves were made, crafted from the songs that Jephre taught to the sylvan youth who frolicked to his lively tunes and ballads of nature and the unspoiled forest. In truth, He is worshipped as god of song and forest.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn Valenwood, Jephre is considered one of the Major Sylvan gods with temples and altars in the deep woodland places. Elven tradition holds that children with a gift for song have been blessed by Jephre himself. Legend has it he blessed the Wood Elves with a natural affinity for nature and particularly the forest. Most Wood Elven Rangers worship Jephre.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt was his great eagerness for natural beauty that led him to the Isle of Sumurset. He taught the great sea birds to sing and molded the crash of wave against beach into a song of whispers and power. It is said by the high elves that Jephre hears and sees all within distance of water, whether it be beach, brook, stream or fall. It is further said that the very birds keep watch for Jephre, in repayment for the songs he taught them. It is further said he blessed the high elves with a beauty to match the beauty of their island home.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe dark elves have a legend that Jephre walked the earth before the first day, and in the light of the stars weaved a song so beautiful that the very stars moved to its sway. Some of the stars to this very day still wink and blink in memory of the song of night and darkness. Due to his influence most if not all Elven Bards pay homage to Jephre.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe natural order of things is the basis for Jephre's temples in Valenwood and the Sumurset Isle. The one thing Jephre will not tolerate is the harmful manipulation of the natural order of things.<BR>\r\n<BR>"

I was admiring the famous animal pens of the Tower when I was approached by an older student. The fellow who told me this tale seemed very trustworthy at first, but, as the reader will soon discover, the tale is very dubious indeed. Of course, I have told it since to other neonates of the Tower in the same spirit.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI offer the following for your august consideration, gentle reader.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMany, many years back, a talented but poor bard was passing through Sumurset, looking for work. He could sing, he could dance, he could act, but no one had any use for his performances. The poor bard was lugubrious, but he still visited the taverns and palaces, day after day, begging for a chance to showcase his talents.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOne day, dejected from more bad luck, he was approached by a tall elf in a long robe. A Magister of the Crystal Tower, in charge of the animal pens. The elf tells the bard of the white ape they made a cell for at the Tower, how it had died en route. There was a royal party from Firsthold visiting who had been promised a glimpse at the rare white ape. The Magister had a costume for the bard if he would deign to act out the part of the ape for the visitors. The bard had promised himself to take the first part that came his way, no matter how minor, so he agreed. The elf promised that the charade would last no longer than a fortnight, when the visitors left.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor the first several days of the masquerade, the bard did nothing more than sit in the back of the pen. He was afraid to move and show the possible imperfections of the ape costume. In time, he became bored and began walking around. He suddenly noticed that the royal party was watching, fascinated. Happy that the ruse was working, he decided to enliven the act.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSoon he had both a performance and a crowd. Instead of dancing a traditional elven jig, he would swing around the cell with every acrobatic trick he knew. Instead of singing a ballad, he would roar a roar he imagined a rare white ape might roar. The crowd loved it. The party outside his cell grew larger and larger every day.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOne day, he was performing for the crowd -- his finest work to date. He swung himself round and round, roaring and bleating. His hand slipped and he went flying through the bar and into the cell next door, where a Snow Wolf was in residence. Hackling its back and growling, the Snow Wolf began to inch toward the bard.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSeeing no other way out, the bard screamed, \"Help! Help!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Snow Wolf whispered, \"Shut up or you'll get us all fired.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>"

In which some (probably unwanted) light is shed upon the Priesthood and its members, and upon an old peasant myth of some significance, especially common in High Rock. And in which the mysterious Fools' Ebony appears, that strange material that could bring either drastic cultural change for the many, or just great profit for a few, or death for a bunch, or have no result whatsoever.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDaggerfall and Environs in the Doldrums of the 3rd Era<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEarly in the month of Frostfall. The Dead Daedra Inn. Enter Prologue<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: Our poor players will try and remember their lines and not trip over our meager set. I beg you, the audience, not to heckle, badger, or throw rotten foodstuffs. You will only make this short play last longer. The Guild of Playwrites, Actors, and Dramatists wish any of you who are sensitive or allergic to rambling dialogue, wooden acting, incomprehensible exposition, or unsatisfying endings that leave one confused and unhappy to exit the theatre immediately. Your gold will, alas, not be refunded. As a saving grace, this series of vignettes contains gratuitous references to all pleasures of the flesh. You may enjoy it. Ah, here comes our hero, the roguish Dark Elf called the Adventurer. It is time for Prologue to trip merrily away.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nExit Prologue<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEnter the ADVENTURER<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: What an odd conversation I just heard between those two mages. It is best not to speak of such matters next to privy hedges.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEnter 2 Priests of Akatosh (LHEBAN, KOMON)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Mind if we join you, fellow? ... Good, need some company ourselves. I am named Lheban, my fellow priest here is Komon. We both serve Akatosh, all in our own ways, of course ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Make yourselves at home, it's not my bench. But I thought that priests ... didn't go to ... er ... places like this, Inns. I mean ... unless on duty?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Oh, we're not on duty. Got to regenerate our internal vital energies, so we can go on blessing and curing ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: We often come here, hike up our robes, kick up our heels, as it were. Fill up with some bottled energy ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Komon snickers)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Looking for those in need of comfort and blessing, of course ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Oh, yes, Oh yes ... like that young girl outside the other evening ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Lheban kicks Komon)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: ... and anyway our High Priest told us to get lost...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: He means told us to get some air. We've been having visions, you see...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Yes, sort of weird, really ... and we hadn't even been taking any of that ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Lheban kicks Komon)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Both of us been having the same visions - real odd.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Do tell, I'm not going anywhere in a hurry.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Well, we've both been hearing sort of ... words ... for a start. Like 'Sir Nich' or 'Sain Nack' ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: You said 'Nick' or 'Nack'? Just a minute ... let me have a swig from your bottle, Brother ... Ah! That's better - high-class stuff you fellows drink! Yes, I recall - some story or old legend about an elf, name of Nuckle, I think -- from Morrowind?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: You know, maybe you're on to something there -- there is a old legend around these parts, comes from deep in High Rock I think ... hmmmm ... Nackles, that's it!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Nackles, eh! Seems that several Dark Elves use that name ... particularly the ... more peculiar ones...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Yes, I guess that the bad ones are into all that weapons magicka stuff ... very nasty fellows ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: (to Komon) Komon! This fellow's got pointy ears and red eyes ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Pardon me, friend ... it's sort of dark, and I didn't ... uh ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh, that's fine. These are strange times. You know, live and let live -- or die -- as the case may be. Now ... suppose you tell me about this Nackles myth? Here, let me help you with that bottle ... Ah! Thanks.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Er ... sure, if you want to put it that way ... Here, have another swig! Sure, we've got the time, and I recall it clearly now.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Yes, we've a couple hours 'til that little blonde shows up at her lamp...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Lheban kicks Komon)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: (to Komon) Quiet! Remember, we had to tell the High Priest her address, so she won't be around for a while!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(to all) Very well, here's the story, best as I can recall it. This is a tale the peasants up in High Rock tell their kids to scare them into being good for a while, I guess. They tell it, let me see ... either on Tales and Tallows, or is it Witches' Festival? -- just before the kids are sent out to the barn or pigsty to sleep.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Nasty cruel peasants! But then, I'd send them all out to the midden ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Really, Komon! Remember, those poor souls need our compassion and blessing, we are their salvation!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Now who's in Old High Mucky-Mucks' study?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Er ... anyway. It goes a bit like this. If the kids have been real good during the year -- filched enough in the market, mucked out the stables every day, not gone playing with goblins, left the sheep alone, and so on. If they have been real good, they've nothing to worry about. But if they haven't been real good then there is this nasty, horrid Dark Elf spirit called Nackles. Doesn't look like your typical Dark Elf -- thinner, taller. Pasty white face, long as your arm. Walks like his knees and elbows bend the wrong way. Snickers like when you drag your fingernails across slate. Wears a tight black suit (not Khajiit, more like a formal suit with buttons) but too tight and small. He visits the bad girls and --<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Why are you talking about Old High Mucky again, Lheban?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Komon hiccoughs) (Lheban kicks Komon)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: You really must excuse Komon here: overwork, you know. Too many curings and conversions ... Anyway, Old Nasty Nackles is supposed to wander under our Tamriel, in dirty deep dark dwarven tunnels. Everywhere under the lands, if you can believe that! Rides in a rusty squeaky old mine cart, on old mine tracks ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: I saw some of those in Fang Lair once, down in Hammerfell a long long while ago ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: (to Lheban) What the Sheogorath was he doing in Fang Lair!?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: (to Komon) Hush! If he's who I think he is, you do not want to know! (to all) Um, yes. Well, Nackles gets pulled all around these deep tunnels by goblins -- not your usual dirty yellow ones, but nasty black things. Anyway, they pull Nackles round and through these dark tunnels, and then, late at night, he stops below each and every bad child's hovel or house or castle - makes no difference. Then he slides up the drainage pipes ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Creeps up cracks ... crawls through holes ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Oozes up oubliettes ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Climbs giggling up garderobes ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Right into the kid's place! Then, if the kid's only been sort of bad, Nackles will just mess things up in general, so the kid gets blamed. Make greasy dirty marks everywhere (more than usual, anyway), break some things, steal some things, so on and so forth. Maybe take the sugar sweets, leave some lumps of fools' ebony instead ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Fools' Ebony - what's that? Heard mention of that, oh, a few hours ago ... Some Mages ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: You did now? Interesting ... Very ... Well, lets talk of that in a bit ... just let me finish this Nackles thing. Where was I -- Oh yes ... Now, if the little brat has been real bad -- then all the little brat's toys get taken. The copper dagger, the wooden sword, the little whip, and so on. All the usual favorite kids things.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Whips? I like those.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Komon hiccoughs) (Lheban kicks Komon)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Now if that little brat has been very, very bad then Nackles grabs the brat. Pops him or her in his dirty great sack. Hauls the sack off down the holes and cracks, down to his rusty old mine cart! And away they go!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Hope he leaves some bad little girls behind.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Lheban kicks Komon)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Er ... so we can save them, of course, friend ... Well. Sometimes, so I've heard tell, the brat never comes back. No great loss, I guess, peasants just breed another.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Know 'bout that, I do, I do ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Lheban pinches Komon's nose)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: But, as the story goes round here anyway, often the brat is just put to work, digging out lumps of Fools' Ebony, shoveling dirt, bagging it. Extending the tunnels of the Nackles. After a while, Brat is pushed back up to where it came from. Seems that Brat might think it's spent a year down there, but only a day has passed up top ... Brat comes back real thin and dirty though, covered in black mess ... You know, come to think of it -- on the day past Witches' Festival, I've often seen some little brats, scrawny, real dirty black mess on them, looking terrified, too. Parents drag them into Temples to get blessed and cured, if they have the gold. By the Beard of Sheogorath, the wailing and noise! Enough to drive a priest to ... er ... well, never mind ... that's our problem ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Nah ... it's a problem with our suppliers, I tell you ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Lheben throws Komon through a screen)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Anyway, that's the short of it, this Nackles legend up around here. I recall now, it's widespread all over Tamriel ... and knowing the place, probably more than a grain of truth in the tale, much, much more ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: So, I guess some of the ... er, darker Dark Elves sort of identify with this Nackles. Take on the persona, so to say ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Yeah, that sort of sums it up, I guess ... though we don't see those types hauling off brats in sacks, now do we?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Nah, that's wot we does, girly brats anyway, isn't it not?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Komon hiccoughs) (Lheban breaks a bottle over Komon's head)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Komon falls unconscious)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Thats a very interesting tale, gentlemen. Say, let me repay you with another bottle -- what's that you're drinking? Ah, thought so - Innkeep! More holy wine for these holy men!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: A blessing on you for that kind gesture, friend.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: I thank you, I sure could use one or three ... Anyway, this 'Fools' Ebony', I've heard mutters and murmurs about that of late -- mostly eavesdropping ... pardon me ... listening ... to Mages and the like. What's with this stuff? Here, have another swig ... good!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Well, we're not supposed to tell outsiders ... but then, you seem to know something already. And if you have been hearing Mage gossip ... Why, maybe we can do some business. Profit all round! Well ... for the Akatosh Chantry, of course, and your fee, good Sir.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: More and more interesting -- tell on, I pray you.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Komon staggers to feet) (Komon hiccoughs)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKOMON: Time for me to go convert that little lamppost girl ... no, no, no - not last nights one, but the blonde ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Komon) (Female squeals from offstage)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Friend, you'll have to excuse Komon. He's a bit ... you know strange ... Got these ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh, that's all right, we've all got our own...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exeunt Lheben and the Adventurer) (Enter EPILOGUE)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEPILOGUE: Our apologies for the quality of this drama so far. If those of you still present will wait for a few minutes while our bard plays \"Silence Implies Consent,\" we will change the set for the next act, Part the Twoth.

Now then, on with the entertainment.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: ... and all that ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: But it helps in our ... holy work, if we are perceived as separate and, uh, competitive...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Mind you, there are one or two, er ... religious organizations ... well, sort of ... that we do not have anything to do with ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Nothing at all, nothing at all ... animals, just animals ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Such as ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Weeell -- the Dark Brotherhood for one ... nasty bunch of thugs ... and then there's the Afterdark Society ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(aside to Raic)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis fellow, seems a decent sort of chap ... seems to know something about Mages and Fools' Ebony ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: (aside to Lheban) Really now ... how interesting...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(to all) Hey fellow, have another bottle -- this will bless you throat. My, my, yes indeed it will...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Thanks Raic, don't mind a bit ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: But let me continue -- I was explaining about this Fools' Ebony to you ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Yes, Fools' Ebony ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Well. Fools' Ebony now. Well, you know about ordinary Ebony, how it's rare, only some dwarven clans dig it and sell it. And not too many, these days and times ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSTETE: How's that popular song go ..? (singing)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhere have all the Old Dwarves gone, Long time ago ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Lheben throws Innkeep at Stete) (Raic breaks chair on Innkeep and Stete) (Innkeep loses consciousness)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: There's a pile of real ebony up in the Wrothgarians somewhere north, I hear tell. You know how that dullish black ebony gets worked over by Mages, by some skilled armorers, made into all kinds of potent weapons, amulets, belts, what have you. All fetch a huge price, when you can find any. And how the best was made long ago, by those old dwarves ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Stete rises to his feet) (Lheban kicks Stete back down) (The Adventurer loosens his tunic)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Oh my! Oh, my apologies, friend, Sir! I see you have -- what's that? An ebony torc? Oh my, and an ebony katana! Oh My! Oh My, My! So, of course, you know all that, sir.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh, that's all right, you didn't know. Here, have another bottle ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Many thanks, kind Sir. Well, then you know how every adventurer, even snotty kids, all the dungeon-delvers, are always looking for ebony artifacts, weapons, whatnot. But what you may not know, some of the more experienced delvers hunt for raw ebony lodes, piles, dwarven leavings. That stuff, the raw ebony, is far more valuable.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: The raw unshaped material that provides work ... and power ... for so few? Apparently just loaded with negative magicka?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Right, right!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Yes, right so! Quite so! Well, Fools' Ebony now. Looks just about like the real raw stuff. Runs in veins in the deep rocks. Feels the same, smells almost the same. But the big difference: it's not real ebony. No power at all. If you pick some up, it gets you hands a bit dirty. Softer too, by all accounts. But sort of shiny too. But who can tell all that, deep in some old mine, maybe a ghoul breathing down your neck! So it's just grab and run, I guess, down in those nasty holes. So the fools, the kids, the crazy delvers, are always hauling up a bag, a sack, of Fools' Ebony. And getting laughed at by the merchants, dealers, mages, us ... hence the Fools' part. Stuff just gets thrown into the Bay ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Yeah, that's sort of what I ... er ... heard from some Mages. But I heard something else, too ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: And just what was that, friend ... if you want to tell us, of course ... Sir.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh, of course! I think that we can come to ... er ... an arrangement?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN and RAIC (Together): Certainly, Oh Yes!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: So, yeah, so these mages -- Shub and Shub, they are always called Shub, aren't they? -- anyway, these old guys were saying how this Fools' Ebony can burn. Not magically, but like an ordinary piece of wood. But the flame lasts far longer, gives off lots more heat, makes no smoke to speak of, no noise ... very interesting ... Mages were saying as how the alchemists want it, to heat the retorts and flasks ... How the Mages Guild wants it, to make and sell ... er ... fake amulets and the like ... rotten trick that! And especially the Armorers, they want it bad, for their forges, I guess. And the Alchemists, for their alembics ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Precisely my information! Now... gets cold up here in the winter, doesn't it? And everyone is cutting down all those trees, making siege engines, boats, all that evil war machinery! All those rich royals and merchants got to heat their great big piles of homes. So their Contessas can run around in next to nothing, instead of furs...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSTETE: ... just like my sister ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Lheben bites Stete's arm) (Stete shreiks and falls unconscious)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: All those armorers got to keep their hearths and furnaces running...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: ... All the Mages got to keep their familiars warm ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: ... All those royals got to keep the contessas running ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: ... All those peasants got to keep their animals warm ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: And To Sheogorath with the wife and kids, right? Ha! And, I guess, its sort of hard for you Priests to give blessings and cures, when your fingers are all cold and stiff ..? Makes getting corks out a tad hard, to say nothing of opening those little twists of parchment ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: You speak truly, indeed!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: A man of wisdom, indeed! Yes!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: So, where do we find this Fools' Ebony -- in quantity?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: You put your finger (you have six, I note -- oh, excuse me, Sir) on the crux of the matter. I have heard rumors, just rumors, mind you, that there are huge enormous veins of this stuff, at one place on the surface, far up in the Wrothgarians. Bad, bad place to go. But, if you can get there and back, cartloads of the stuff!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Thats just what I overheard from those Mages -- far up there in the Wrothgarians -- orcs, dragonlings, daedra, Sheogorath only knows what ... Those Mages seemed to know the spot, though. Mages wanted someone to ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: You didn't ... talk ... to the Mages. I mean, you haven't ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh no. They didn't even know I was there...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(aside) Not yet, anyway...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Good, good - can't trust those Mages, you know ... old fossils would turn their own mothers into sludge-toads, just for a bit of gold! Gold-mad, power-mad, Mad-mad, the whole rotten lot of them! But then they don't have mothers!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Excellent. Seems to me, friend -- or, can we call you partner? Yes? Excellent. Seems tome, partner, that my brother priests and you should do some digging and poking around - see if we can get to those veins, those deposits, eh!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Yes indeed, partners! But it would cost a fair pile of gold to get up there -- weapons, spells, women, clothing, carts and horses, women, food, potions ... Best go well-prepared, up there.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: No problem, partner. Our Temples have ... certain resources, such that if we were guaranteed ... sole access, sole knowledge of the location, then we could finance someone ... someone with the requisite skills, such as yourself? Just by happenstance, I am Keeper of the Books ... you see the opportunity?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh yes! Oh yes! Well -- lets split a last bottle, and shake on an agreement?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Indeed, let us! We first need information -- who knows about the site up there, where it is, how to reach it ... Why don't we meet back here in, say, a week, to the hour. And see what we can learn, meanwhile?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: We need to find a merchant, too. Someone who can handle it for us ... warehouses, distribution ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: And keep a shut mouth!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: I'll make some inquiries about merchants ... got a contact or two ... Trouble is -- well, you know how these things go -- few golds here, few there, before you know it you've bribed half the town, or so it seems. Now, as luck would have it, I don't have much -- got swindled by a wretched Mage, some town south of here, and lost most of my belongings in a shipwreck ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Ah Yes! You need some ... seed money as it were.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: (To Lheban) Let me lift old Stete's purse, he made a lot renting out his sister last week ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Thank you, Raic. Here, about 100 gold -- enough ?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh yes, more than enough for a start, Gentlemen. Good, good, good ... so we have a deal?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Yes! It's agreed. One week!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Lheban, Raic dragging Stete) (Exit the Adventurer)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Epilogue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEPILOGUE: Ah, things are happening now, I doubt it not. Patrons, I request that you recall that this is a work of fiction created by one of the finest writers of the asylum, Frincheps, Archprince of All Sumurset. There is no such thing as Fools' Ebony. Furthermore, Ebony is not mined as the priests have described the process. Grasp that please. If you can still enjoy the play as a rude work of fiction, stay with us for Part the Threeth. If you can't, farewell. And don't forget to tip the wenches.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnd so endeth Part the Twoth<BR>"

If you are just arriving, you have missed little. The Adventurer, our rogue Dark Elf, has joined with a quadripartite (that's a triumvirate plus one) of priests intent on discovering a burning metal called Fools' Ebony and becoming wealthy. The priests have given our hero some gold for bribing merchants, but the only people who know where the Fools' Ebony is are the mages of the Mages' Guild. As the Epilogue pointed out at the end of Part the Twoth, there is no such thing as Fools' Ebony and real Ebony is not mined. Something our playwrite apparently did not research. Well, accept it as high fantasy, if you will. Or whatever. Hark, here comes our hero now. Imagine the miasma (if that's the word I want) of magical elixirs, bubbling cauldrons, hovering balls of sparkling whatnot. And now, the Prologue must depart.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter the Adventurer and SHUB)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Ho! Anyone around?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Over here, young man, in the corner ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Morning. Do I call you ... Shub ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Oh yes, Shub is my name, Shub it is ... How on Tamriel did you know?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Can we have some ... privacy ... I have a somewhat ... er ... delicate matter to discuss..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: No need for privacy here! We Mages do not hide anything!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Fools' Ebony?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Quick through this door ..! Turn right ... Turn left ... Ah ... just let me throw a privacy spell around us ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Loud zap sounds) (Enter SHUB)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGood! Now Sir -- Oh, by the way, meet my fellow Mage, Shub.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Mmmm.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Now, you mentioned Fools' Ebony ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, I fancy myself a bit of an expert in ebony. Had quite a bit come and go through my hands in my time, I have ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: We notice that you have an ebony amulet, and an ebony katana -- Of Lightning, no less! And an ebony belt ... ...mmmm...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Hands off the toys, gentlemen, please!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Forgive us -- but we so appreciate such fine items ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: ... collect them too ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, the other day, just by chance of course, I just happened to hear two priests of the Temple of ... er ... Stendarr, I think it was ... They were a bit high in their cups, I think, a bit loud, and never noticed me skulking -- I mean, standing -- there. They were going on about this Fools' Ebony - stuff like the real thing, only no magicka at all. None. But it burns like wood, only longer, hotter, no smoke, nice even heat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Yes ... we have heard similar rumors. Seen a bit of that stuff -- lumps from a sack or two that some crazed delver dragged up, that kind of thing. Right, Shub?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Oh - Oh yes, right, that kind of thing ... right ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(aside) I must remember to keep the secret, whatever it is.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, these fool priests seemed to talk as if they knew a location for lots, I mean piles, of that stuff -- somewhere up in the Wrothgarians ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB and SHUB (Together): Where! Who! Did they say? How? When? Where?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: You didn't let them know you were listening, did you?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Of course not! What do you take me for, a priest lover?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Calm yourself, my lord ... that's better...just don't go fiddling with that katana so much. Makes us nervous.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Yes, nervous, very ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Here, sit down. There. Want some mulled wine? No? Oh well, just have to finish it myself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: So they seemed to know the location.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(aside) Hmmmm. This means we have to act fast, quickly, speedily, and with great rapidity.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh yes! They were talking like they were going to get a load in a few weeks or so ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Oh My! Oh Dear Me! Ohhh...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Now then. Seems you know a fair amount about this Fools' Ebony. And you realize the potential -- just think, big warm fires in all our study rooms ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB and SHUB (Together): ... Selling it to the Palace... selling it to those stupid Alchemists ... the Armorer's Guild would be good for a lot ... ...keep out familiars nice and warm ... ... and our posteriors ..! ... just think how Daedra Seducers love a nice warm fire ... Giving smoldering lumps to the peasants to warm their hovels with - in return for some gold, of course ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: ...just think of all that gold...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Trouble is, son - we would like to get that stuff by the cartload, bring it down here ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Have some trustworthy merchant ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Put a spell on him!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: ... Have some merchant act as sort of, middleman, for us ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: But ... then why the delay, gentlemen?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: You seem like an honest fellow. We'll tell you -- mind you, you let out a word of this, and there will be a Fire Daedra in your bed ... but no threats between gentlemen, right!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Very well -- I shall be the very soul of discretion.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: You see, we know where the stuff it, cartloads and cartloads of it. But we can't get there and back ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: We are not the outdoorsy types.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Far safer here in town.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Much warmer too.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Think of all the supplies we would have to take.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: All those nasty things out there.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Did you know that seducers won't come to us in the wilderness?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: We'd have to hire guards, to keep those awful priests away.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: And the strain of dealing with all those coarse types ... the Merchants.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: The Armorers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: The Royals.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Mmm. I think I comprehend. You want some -- experienced explorer-hero type, someone used to the wilderness - to go get it for you, set up a supply line, so on ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Exactly. And find us a nice, useable merchant. Someone we can control.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: With a big, big warehouse, delivery service, that kind of thing ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, gentlemen. Let me volunteer my services! I have always admired you Mage gentlemen -- so clever, so sharp. No fooling you in anything, is there?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: No, no fooling us ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: This, ladies and gentlemen, is irony.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Tell you what, I can probably arrange a suitable merchant or you. Take some gold though -- those thieves know the value of a gold piece! As luck would have it, my last gold was swindled off me by a thieving priest, in some little town south of here. And I lost a lot of good stuff in a shipwreck just before that ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Well ... since you have agreed to help us ... we can spare some gold from the treasury, can't we, Shub?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Oh! Oh yes, lots there ... always make more ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Now, I do need to know roughly where this site is, got to pick the right breed of horse, calculate my supplies to the last drop, figure out what weapons I might need ... supplies, like food, little things like that ... diameter of the cart wheels in square yurts ... ambush points for the priests, in case they try to get up there ... mmmmm ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Tell you what - here is 500 gold. Go get things started.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Yes ... we can always make some more.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: (aside, to Shub) Shut up!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Shub fires a spell at Shub that burns him to a cinder and then reconstitutes him)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(to all) Excuse us ... where was I ... Oh ... get a merchant, guards, carts, whatever you think it will take. Come back if you need more.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: But what about those priests?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: I've an idea or two there. Let me get friendly with them - maybe hire a couple of good lamppost girls, lay in a few cases of holy wine ... I'll have them eating out of my hand in no time. And if you show me where this Fools' Ebony is ... why, I can misdirect them, send them straight into an trolls' den or something.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: You're the expert! Here, let me show you on a map ... and I don't need to mention Fire Daedras, do I?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: So ... seems to be ... hmmmm ... only thirty days there, this time of year. Maybe forty back, with the loads. Let me study this a bit more ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Can't take it with you, of course ... don't want this getting out now ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh no. That's fine. Look, let me have a bit more gold. Going to need some heavy-duty carts. See here, this section ... cut by all these washes ... hmmmm ... the flummox there will be something terrible ... Oh, and these ruins, full of ghosts, I bet ... hmmmm ... and this pass, just full of willies too ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: If you say so ... My, seems that we picked the right man, right, Shub!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: Oh yes, indeed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: So -- why don't I make arrangements, get back to you in ... er ... say a week? Say -- sure that you don't want to come with me. After all, there's nothing like the wilderness life. Waking up with the sun, shaking off the frost. Catching an orc for breakfast - ever have orc guts fried over stinkwood? Oh, that's a treat! Checking each stream for dead giant spiders - or live ones! Imp jerky for lunch! Scanning the ridges for dragonlings! Standing guard against Ice Daedra in a blinding snowstorm! Oh, what a life!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB and SHUB (Together): No, no ... we, we better stay here at the Guild. Got our duties after all ... someones got to mind the store ... someones got to get the word out to selected customers ... No, thank you kind Sir, it does sound such a lovely life, but I think we best be here ... yes, indeed ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: A pity, gentlemen. Well, I'll be about it then. And don't worry if you see me with those priests -- got to mislead and misdirect them, haven't I!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSHUB: One week, then!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exeunt Shub, the Adventurer, and Shub) (Enter Epilogue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEPILOGUE: Shub and Shub, ladies and gentlemen. Implausibly retarded mages, yes, but perhaps there's something more to them than this act suggests. Do you think so, maybe? Well, if you are not in the theater for Part the Fourth, you won't know for certain, will you? Don't forget to tip your wenches and think on that while we change the set.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSo Endeth Part the Three<BR>\r\n<BR>"

After some general discussion and verbal dancing around, finally the topic of Fools' Ebony is explored ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSomewhere near the market, in the back of a store called \"Nephron's General Mercantile\".<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe day after.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Prologue, the Adventurer, and NEPHRON)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: Whilst the actors playing the Adventurer and the merchant Nephron dramatically move their mouths to pantomime a conversation, it is on poor Prologue's shoulders to update the audience on the play's actions in its first three acts. The Adventurer, a rogue of a Dark Elf, has been hired two different groups -- four inebriated priests and two greedy mages -- to delay the other group, and find the lost cache of Fools' Ebony in the Wrothgarian Mountains. Now, picture this clownishly decorated set as the back room at a prosperous merchant's shop. And before the Adventurer and Nephron develop lockjaw, Prologue will leave you thus.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: So you see, friend Nephron, just what an opportunity we have here. We have this new commodity, for which you agree there will be a huge demand.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: Especially from the Royals -- once one of them has something new, they all want it, of course.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: And do not forget the Armorers for their forges, and the Alchemists for their retorts and whatnots...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: You seem to have the Mages lined up nicely, got their location, memorized the access map, and so on - you know, we merchants have had a suspicion for quite some time that those old twits had some deep dark secret of interest to us... Now, the priests - the School of Julianos we already work well with, hand and glove, you might say. But of course we shall cut them out of the major profits -- maybe let them distribute some to their flocks? And their Temples make good, how can I say? -- storehouses? But the Akatosh Chantry is a problem, always running off and doing things on their own initiative, no cooperation, just crazy people ... we really need to do something about them, to ... er ... ensure their cooperation ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: I have a suggestion that might help ... you recall how old Komon left and apparently dragged off some little blonde lamppost girl ... just suppose, that just by chance, in his state of ... befuddlement ... he dragged off someone important by mistake..? Might be a lot of trouble for the Chantry, if word got out?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: Hmmm. Indeed ... there's this silly little blonde Royal who's all excited by the 'real life' down in these parts of town. Disguises herself (or so she thinks), comes on down here and plays at being poor. Stupid little twit ... Komon is still in hiding with his blonde, right?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Yes, in that 'retreat' the Priests have, down near the waterfront.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: Oh yes, I know that place - often sell them some 'spiritual powders' and so on ... Good ... you see, just imagine what would happen if Komon, by mistake, had grabbed this slumming little Contessa ... Akatosh Chantry would have no end of trouble from the palace if something nasty happened to her ... and then we could move in, offer to 'help' the Chantry during their hard times ... Hmmm. Yes! Leave it to me, I shall contact a few of my ... er ... business associates, as it were ... make some arrangements.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: And I'll keep up chatting with the priests, get them to support our little business venture?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: Right! And I should introduce you to some of the more senior members of our Brotherhood ... excuse me, Guild. Let me contact you in a few days, when everything is all set. You are here every evening?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Yes, not particularly safe outside after dark these days.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: I see. We shall have to arrange some ... protection for you. Well, in a few days, then.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Nephron, inconspicuously) (Enter FIVE ARMORERS)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Armorers and the Adventurer fight) (The Adventurer falls)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Armorers tie the Adventurer up and then wake him up)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 1: OK, fellow. Lets not spriggen-foot around! We know about this Fools' Ebony thing. And about the Mages who apparently discovered the location. And we have been watching you dance around with the Priests, the Mages, the Merchants. Just about everyone with two feet!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 2: And how you are really working with Nephron.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 3: And how you are double-crossing the Priests and Mages ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 2: You and Nephron are really doing a good job on the Akatosh Chantry, we must admit.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 1: But now, we want that Fool's Ebony supply. We need it to increase our production, our quality -- and our prices. We can work with Nephron and his gang, we need warehouses and distribution anyway.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 4: We could torture it out of you ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 3: We could let the Priests know about your plans -- they would throw you to the Afterdark Society in a flash!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 5: We could let the Mages know -- they would send you to Oblivion for a very, very long time!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 1: But we would rather you 'joined' our Guild. We cannot afford to leave Daggerfall for some hairy wilderness trip. Too much demand these days, for our services.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 2: But we can send a group of our apprentices along to keep you company.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 4: Our apprentices usually test all our products ... and will be just itching to test out there.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Gentlemen, gentlemen! Please - I really was going to give the whole deal to you, once I had gotten gold from everyone else.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Armorer 5 slaps the Adventurer with a hot poker)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOhhh ... well, I thought of it...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 5: Sure! And I'm a Nymph!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Yes, Yes, Yes, you are very persuasive. I would welcome an ... er ... escort and guard of such tough gentlemen. Be very handy out there.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 1: Good. Thought you would see it our way! Some of our other members are presently having a little ... chat with Nephron. We can handle him. And from now on, two of our bigger apprentices will always be close at hand. Protection, of course - this town can be quite dangerous at night ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nARMORER 3: So continue with your arrangements, work with Nephron. You can always leave word about your departure date with any weapons shop. And about any problems you may have ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Certainly, gentlemen. Yes, you are indeed very persuasive. I shall keep you up to date. And, er...thanks for the protection.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter ORTHO, the very large apprentice) (The Adventurer is untied) (Exeunt Five Armorers)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Hello, who are you?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nORTHO: Me am Ortho!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: My ... protection?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nORTHO: Me am Ortho!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: You look very familiar to me for some reason. Have you every been to Morrowind?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nORTHO: Me am Ortho!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Fine then. (aside) My old man used to say the very worst thing that can happen to a fellow is an evening spent in the company of an earnest politician. This, I think, is a close second.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exeunt the Adventurer and Ortho) (Enter Epilogue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEPILOGUE: Our play has six parts, and we've just finished the fourth. It's interesting I think that the Lusty Contessa has not made an appearance yet. You don't suppose our playwrite forgot he put her in the Dramatis Personae, do you? Well, you'll only know if you come back for The Fools' Ebony, Part the Fiveth. And if your neighbor decides not to return, don't tell him what happened. We actors have to make a living too, you know. Don't forget to tip your wenches while we change the scene.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Epilogue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSo Endeth Part The Fourth<BR>\r\n<BR>"

In the quest for Fools' Ebony, that substance that all would kill for, the Adventurer attempted to play Mage against Priest with the help of the merchant Nephron. Alas, that is to say, alackaday, the five armorers have trapped Nephron and the Adventurer and taken over their scheme. The hulking Ortho now watches the Adventurer's every move. But I get the feeling -- to be honest, don't you? -- that beneath the Adventurer's defeated quivering jelly lurks a jungle cat of such cunning and resource to shatter all his enemies when the time is right. Of course, I could be wrong. Ah, I see one of the priests of Akatosh who believes himself a friend of the Adventurer. I, Prologue must away.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Prologue) (Enter Lheban, a Priest of Akatosh.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Evening there, mind if I join you?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well ... since you already have - no. And where is our esteemed brother Komon this chill evening?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: You mean you haven't heard -- Oh, I guess you have been busy with the ... preparations?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Right, right, very busy...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Then let me tell you -- Oh, what a bad business. What trouble ... Oh Dear ... Well ... you doubtless recall that poor Komon had this ... er ... problem -- overwork of course!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh yes -- you fellows do work exceeding hard, seems to me.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Well ... recall how Komon left, somewhat erratically as it were, and ... er ... made off with that young blondie under the lamppost outside? Well -- in his ... er ... state of confusion - he grabbed the wrong blondie - Oh My, indeed the wrong one ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: They all look pretty much the same to me, but of course, I do not look too hard!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Oh My! Well, to cut a short tale to the bone, old Komon grabbed a Contessa, who had thought to 'disguise herself.' Oh Dear!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well -- did she get away? Did they catch Komon? What happened?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Well, old Komon, tipsy as he was, was quick as spit in a gale. Eluded all pursuit, took the lady to a small private ... retreat house that we have. Oh Dear Me! Well, the City Guards, Palace guards, half a dozen Royals, all caught up with Komon 3 days later. One day too late for the poor Contessa -- I hear that they had a hard time locating all the ... er ... bits and pieces. Komon was there, passed out cold. And another body, some common blond lamppost girl. And by now he is cold -- permanently, most likely at the bottom of the Bay.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh well. Serves the Contessa right, coming down to this area. But I suppose that there are repercussions?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter two more Priests, Raic and Stete of Julianos, and four armed City Guards.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Evening, Lheban. Evening, Adventurer. And --<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nORTHO: Me am Ortho.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Yesss. Charmed. And Lheban, you indeed have my sympathies ... if there is anything we can do to help -- our Temple of Julianos, that is ..? But really, you should have kept Komon on a tighter leash - or preferably a noose!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Hello Raic. And hello to you, Stete - how's your sister?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSTETE: Oh, she's great.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Raic sets Stete on fire, but it goes out)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Yes, I know I know. Oh the repercussions! Do you know that the Priests of Akatosh to Daggerfall Castle, Wayrest Palace and just about everywhere else have all been thrown out? That the Royal tax exemption for the Chantry has been revoked? That the Akatosh Chantry has just received a 'past due taxes' bill? Oh My!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well ... I suppose that we could help somewhat, maybe? Maybe a small loan from Julianos for that tax bill? With, say, a Temple as security? Oh -- are not the taxes based on the number of the Priests of Akatosh? So, maybe ... the School of Julianos could take over a ... significant number? Reduce your tax bill? You realize that this is not the best time for this -- just as we need a lot of funds for that expedition that I am arranging for you.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Oh, I am so sorry about Komon! But, yes, maybe if good brother Raic could -- I hate to say this -- take over a greater share of the financial burden ..? In return, of course, for ... er ... considerations ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Hmm. Like a good number of 'permanently' loaned priests? A long look at your books? At your cellar? Your name-lists? A Temple as security on our loan? And, of course, a bigger cut in the proceeds of this ... expedition? Names of your ... er ... suppliers ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Oh. I foresaw something like this, talked a bit about it with old Mucky-Muck - livid, he was. But, as I am a Senior Brother, he finally authorized me to 'take care of it.' Those weren't his exact words, mind you, which were quite a bit ...longer, more explicit ... but the gist, at least.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Of course, Lheban. If -- and note I say 'if' -- if we are successful, why then you can easily get back into good graces at the Palace. Merely sell them the goods, as a good low rate! With first refusal on any shipment you have? What's one Contessa to them, anyway?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Yes, yes! That could work! Worth a try. But how? Royals will not talk to anyone from the Akatosh Chantry now.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Leave that to me, I can make ... approaches to certain ones. Yes, I can probably persuade them to let up on the Chantry, in return for... future favors ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Oh, Oh how can I thank you?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, I need a fair amount of gold to finish setting up my little trip. Maybe 10,000? Special horses, reinforced carts, cartiers, guards ... the list goes on and on. And the cost of keeping our little trip quiet is really quite high.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Well, yes, we can afford it, I guess -- you do have the map now, don't you? I know we can afford 8,000 gold. Given the potential profits ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Rest easy! - it's all here in my cloak -- show you in a bit. I've also managed to ... hire some good young hefty fellows, like old Ortho here, to manage the carts, dig and load, act as guards, and so on ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Good, good - I can relax a bit. Oh my, the fellows back at the Chantry will be so relieved. We really owe you, the Brotherhood does -- Oh, I mean the Akatosh Chantry, of course!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSTETE: Brotherhood ..? What about our sisterhood, eh?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Raic grapples Stete, allowing Lheban to hit Stete with a large mallet)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, Raic, what about you and the School? How much are you good for, the extra 2000? And maybe some more - always lots of last minute expenses on a trip like this, you know.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Well now. Since we seem to getting a whole extra sect of Priests, and ... other considerations ... Certainly!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, gentlemen -- Oh, and Stete -- here it is!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Adventurer pulls out a map, gives it to Raic)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOh, by the Arms of Zenithar, did I ever have to work hard for this! Those cagey Mages! But, in the end, just greedy old fools! ... Oh, just in case you or your, er, Head Priest, hasn't seen the goods -- here's a sample. Play with it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Adventurer hands Raic a small leather bag)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Thank you, thank you. I must admit, I had some ... well, some doubts. You know - dealing with a stranger, so on ... No more. Partner!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Good, good!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Stete hiccoughs)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSTETE: Say, you fellows ever hear this one -- what's a Priest keep under his robe? Haha -- His sister! Haheheha!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Adventurer, Lheban, and Raic beat Stete into unconsciousness)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: You know, I fear that we really have to do something about young Stete here ... his sister thing ... ugh!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Yes, he could be another Komon -- just what don't need!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Hmmmm. This sister of his -- does she really -- exist?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Oh yes. My. Oh yes. We know her well - I mean, we have often seen her ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: I think, Brother, that she should be made to see the errors of her ways. So she is no longer an influence on Stete ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Yes, most certainly ... Hmmm ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: A somewhat Dibelytical theological point -- Oh, please excuse the technical discussion here - Raic, if we are to make her see the errors -- well, how shall I put it -- we first have to know just what the ... ways ... are, correct?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Indeed, an astute observation! Hmmm ... so you are suggesting that ... in a nut, we should first determine her ... ways, so as to be able to then show her the ... er ... errors?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Precisely! Mind you, a difficult, ardous, tiring project, I fear. One that will take all our ... will and energy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Hmmm, true. But challenging, eh? Take all our time - but then, we shall have some time, while friend the Adventurer here is off hauling and carting.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: And ... I personally, would feel far safer if we were ... in retreat maybe. Studying the ways ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Yeah -- be a good idea for you two to, maybe, disappear? For a while, of course. Cut down on the chances of a ... rival faction catching on? Or catching you?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Very well! Lheban, why don't you and I take his sister off with us on a ... theological retreat, as it were? Study the ways in details, and so on ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: We could go to that unused little Temple, up on that shoulder of Edward's Mountain ... out of the way, quiet ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Door has locks ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Thick walls ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: A big cellar ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Good! It's settled then. A theological retreat! Oh goody!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Of course, once we know the ... er ... ways in detail, we can of course tell old High Mucky-Muck, and let him take care of the ... er ... showing of the errors ..? Yes, that would improve his mood quite a bit ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Then it's agreed. Let's start, say, day after tomorrow?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Yes! Adventurer, why don't I meet you at, oh, that horrid ugly statue of ... what on Tamriel is it? - a harpy and a gargoyle? Called something silly like 'Vendigao and Her Lover' or some such? Up in the north west corner of the town. Oh, and can I keep the map?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Sure, keep it, I have a copy. And you will pass me a small bag, there at that nasty statue?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Have it all ready for you -- say, ten o'clock sharp? Oh, Lheban, another thought about young Stete here. He really needs some ... seasoning in the field, one might say ...?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLHEBAN: Hmmm. Good point ... I know! The priest who handles field assignments is coming by tomorrow. We could arrange an ... educational ...assignment for Stete?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRAIC: Very good! But where ... hmmm ... Winter's coming soon now. There's a vacancy up in Solitude, far north Skyrim, I believe. Night collections at street corners, or some such. Very Good! Come on, Lheban. We have accounts to work on. Good night to you then, Adventurer. Ten tomorrow morning! (Lheban, Raic rise to leave, picking up Stete)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLheban and Raic (Together): ... have to arrange some supplies ... ... leather, rope ... holy wine .... ... lots of that pink powder ... I prefer the green, myself ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exeunt Lheban, Raic dragging Stete, and City Guard)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: Well?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Excellent. Went just as I said it would. Got 5000 gold from them. And, thanks to your work with that Contessa ... we have the screws on the Chantry. And the School of Julianos is going to be ... otherwise engaged ... on a theological retreat. More like a Sanguine retreat!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: And those Mages Shub and Shub seem to have disappeared ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: So we are set?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: Yes, you can come by my warehouse tomorrow afternoon. Have the heavy carts waiting.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nORTHO: And Ortho ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNEPHRON: Oh yes, must not forget you fellows. How kind of you to ... volunteer your services ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Tomorrow, then!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exeunt omnes) (Last person to leave looks just like a Royal in disguise ...) (Enter Epilogue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEPILOGUE: Well, we only have one part left to this play and I've run out counting the number of loose strings. Either Part the Sixth is going to be eight hours long, or we're going to leave some parts unsolved. I for one hope that they don't chose to drop the character of the Wanton Contessa. For Jephre's sake, she's been on the Dramatis Personae since Part the Oneth. Ah, well. Nobody leave your seat. Your gold will not be refunded. Any gold you can spare to tip your friendly wenches will be greatly appreciated. We just have a quick costume change and a set to put together and we'll be back. In the meanwhile, enjoy our bard's rendition of the Nordic classic \"Alas, The Fleeting Years Glide By.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSo Endeth Part The Five<BR>\r\n<BR>"

Ortho climbs into bed.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: Thank you for allowing us the time to change the meager set, while our bard sang that old favorite, \"Hail and Farewell.\" Now then, imagine, if you will, the luxuriant and langorous suite of that Dark Elven rogue, the Adventurer, at the Dead Daedra Inn. The time is shortly after the last scene, which if you've forgotten, ended with our hero and his partner-in-crime, Nephron, making some arrangements to swindle from the mages, priests, and armorers. All are interested in getting their hands on a lode of Fools' Ebony, a miraculous burning mineral, and the priests and mages each consider the Adventurer their ally. The Armorers know better and have assigned one of their apprentices, Ortho, to watch the Adventurer's movements. Now, as Ortho slumbers, the Adventurer has his first moment of peace in days. I should mention that in the interest of common decency, this scene has been abbreviated from the original by order of the Guild of Playwrites, Actors, and Dramatists. It now contains little material of relevance. A full copy may be obtained from the playwrite after the show for a mere 50 g.p. copying fee. Now is the time for poor Prologue to shuffle away.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Prologue) (The Adventurer begins to get undressed)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Tap-tap at the door. Adventurer jumps, startled) (Snore from Ortho)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Who's there? I'm coming!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Opens door - carefully) (Enter CONTESSA)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Er, well ... er ... Come In! Please.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Adventuer steps back, tripping over his trousers around his ankles ...)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: So sorry to surprise you, but I thought that we might find something in common ... Oh! You poor man, you have a wound! Here, let me fix that bandage ... it looks very fresh.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Fixing bandage, properly this time)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, I ... just opened it up again. Evening exercises, calisthenics, so on...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: How did you get this cut - if you do not mind me asking?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: No, not at all. I was ... in a fight, earlier. These three crazy people jumped me.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Really? This cloth looks like part of a Mage's robe.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, yes, two of them were Mages.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh My! You must have been very good, to defeat them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh, ah, well, I've been in one or two fights. Not to be rude, but who are you?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh, I am so sorry, I quite forgot the proper introductions. I am the Contessa Aveet Videspreed -- call me Ave. From the Court at Daggerfall.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER (aside): By Oblivion, what now?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Here, help me off with this robe, these inn rooms are always ... so hot. And let me check that bandage again, poor man. Ooh, you are wearing an ebony belt of stamina, and bracers of strength. Ooh, a bracelet of endurance. This is my lucky night.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER (aside): Help.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Here, let me help you off with that old shirt - got to check you for any more cuts - they can go bad so easily, you know.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER (aside): Well, its not the Armorers this time. Maybe my luck has turned.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Well, everything seems all right...very all right, in fact...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Er...well, Ave - tell me about ... er ... yourself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: If you want - just for a bit -<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Here, have some wine ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: Here our worthy playwrite's speech has been heavily edited by the Guild of Playwrites, Actors, and Dramatists. I will endeavor to fill in those removed passages. I should first mention that the Contessa is not meant to be a relative of any noble currently in Castle Daggerfall. The Contessa Aveet regales the Adventurer with tales of the peculiar and hearty members of her royal family. She has many brothers and sisters. They are all very -- close.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: I think I must have been a bastard. I was the only one with red hair, and an affinity for magicka. Everyone else tried to hide this skill of mine. I remember one spanking very well ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa relates further differences between her siblings.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: While my sisters were learning to curtsey in ten different modes, and my brothers were learning flower-arranging, I used to sneak off into the woods or town. I soon learnt how to get what I wanted, from just about anyone. Just for example, there was this merchant who had three sons ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa goes into detail about her training.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: I became quite good at the school of illusion. You never noticed me, downstairs, did you?. I also learned how to use some weapons. Let me tell you how I learned hand-to-hand ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa relates an amusing anecdote, and then continues.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: And on bad days, I used to dig in my father's library. He had a marvelous collection of old texts. I was fascinated by Old Dwarvish, managed to learn it quite well, I think. Of course, no one has seen or spoken to one in years and years. So its probably perfectly useless knowledge. But I've always had an interest in collecting new knowledge. At the Mages Guild, they taught me an old High Elven tradition. You spread this potion all over your body...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa relates her current state of boredom.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: The life up at the Palace bores me so. My sisters ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa's sisters are entertaining some visitors.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: And my brothers are now studying Advanced Floral Theory, so I come down here, do a little ... er ... business. I keep all my relations supplied with their favorite vices -- so I can blackmail the whole rotten lot.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: But isn't it dangerous, down here? Did I not hear that some young Contessa got killed, recently?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: That little twit was my cousin, and as far as I'm concerned, she got what she deserved. She thought she could just borrow a maids dress, muss up her hair, and pass for commoner. She was spotted the first minute she left the Palace gates. Now, I use illusion, craft, guile -- and I carry weaponry. By the way, that was a neat scheme you and Neph cooked up.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, lets change the subject, can we? ... Just what do you carry? I can't see anything ... like a weapon, I mean ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Here, let me show you ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh my, those are nice ... knives...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: And there're more ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh yes...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: But we don't need these silly nasty weapons now, do we?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: My, my -- now those are what I call weapons ... Oh yes ... heavy duty, high class ones too, my ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: I think its time that we put that ebony to the test ... to say nothing of your Mages Staff ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: At this point, extensive material has been removed. However, please remember that any scholar who truly wishes to peruse this material can obtain a copy for only 50 g.p. - hand-drawn illustrations are of course extra. The Contessa, after a bit of fun, volunteers to be a part of the Adventurer's party to find the fools' ebony lode. I know, I know. It didn't make much sense in the original draft either, if you want to know the truth.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Sure you want to go out there in the wilds?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh, yes. I am so bored here. Well, not right here and now, but generally. And I can really be of assistance. I'm pretty good with woods survival, knife work, hand-to-hand ... and it gets cold out there at night, even for big ebony-wearing men like you ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: All right, then. Do you know where and why we are going?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh, of course. It's all over Daggerfall. Everyone is watching and waiting to see what happens. There is even a lottery or two running ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: On what ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh, your life.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh dear Oh dear! Oh my!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Look, don't worry -- I know all about the double-dealings with mages, priests, merchants, those crude armorers. And I intend that we come out on top. I love being on top. With the goods and the profits. I'll have yet another vice to sell to my stupid relatives in their boring palaces.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: But won't it be us two against hordes?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh no. Most everyone is waiting here in town to see what and who comes back. And I will have a surprise arranged for our 'escorts' - Ortho included. Out in the wilderness, they can be dealt with easily.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Ortho snores)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Tell me more.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Certainly. But first ... lets see how many uses you have left in that ebony. Mmm, your Mages' Staff is in good shape ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: Exactly. Sorry to interrupt again, but we're going to have to stop this scene right here. After a frenzied night comes the placid dawn, tripping onto the sky like a budding rose. And then another day doth dawn, and then another. Ten dawns and ten frenzied nights pass as our wily Adventurer, the wanton Contessa, the clever and naughty Nephron, the loutish Ortho, and an assemblage of randy armorers and backsliding maidens take to the road. Imagine now that we are in the wildy wilderness of High Rock near the Wrothgarian Mountains.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScene 2<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Nephron and assorted lads and lasses) (Exit Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: I do so love a bucolic frolic.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: It's getting pretty wild now. I guess the dangerous part is coming up tomorrow...?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Yes, one last stop tonight, at that old inn up here -- Minnie's Inn.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Minnie's Inn? Oh, those two old scholars who gave it all up, came to run the inn out here. they must get all of two customers a year.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: I think they like the solitude. It gives them time to study. They know a lot about old Dwarvish stuff - get them started on that, they will wear you ears out.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Er ... when does your surprise happen? I should probably know.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Don't fret, dear. At the Inn tonight. Just sit back and enjoy the show.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: Time passes, the carts roll, things happen in the backs of the carts. And there are strange furtive movements unnoticed by all, on the high ridges around. When next we see our players, they are at Minnie's Inn, home of Minnie and Crunn, the philosopher- innkeeps. Imagine, if you will, the rather dusty dining room of Minnie's Inn.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter MINNIE, CRUNN, and GURNSEY) (Exit Prologue) (Gurnsey goes to Orthos' table with more ale for him. She sits down suddenly. She stares into Orthos' eyes, Ortho stares into hers. Mouths drop open.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... er ... Crunn ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... yes ... Minnie ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... I was thinking ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... yes, you were thinking, Minnie ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... er .... thinking ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... yes ...so was I ....<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... can't remember now ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... yes, Minnie ... Minnie ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... Yes ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... Shut up ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGURNSEY and ORTHO (Together): Moo ... oooh ... moo.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Moo?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: See, Adventurer, Ortho's fixed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Is he?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: You just watch.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: And what about the other armorers?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Any minute now.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Ortho and serving girl arise, approach Adventurers' table. The floor shakes.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nORTHO: This Gurnsey. Ortho love Gurnsey, oooh.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGURNSEY: Gurnsey love Ortho ... moo ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nORTHO: We go get marry, we is.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Well, congratulations! And that was a fine long speech, Ortho!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nORTHO: We go raise piggies.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGURNSEY: Grows animals too, farmers be we.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Ortho and Gurnsey)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Extraordinary. Ave, I think that you must have been up here before.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh yes. I often come up here to get away from the Palace and talk dwarves with Minnie and Crunn.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: You mean that these two ancient ... er, Scholar-InnKeeps can actually talk and about dwarves?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(All but Adventurer, Contessa, Minnie, and Crunn fall asleep in their meat pies.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh yes, you must just be very patient. But look over at our other escorts ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: By the Lady!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Minnie was an Alchemist before she met Crunn, and knows a lot of old forgotten Dwarvish potions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: But what do we do with the bodies?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Wait ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter MAJOR)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Adventurer, meet Major Bloodnok, head of my own ...private little bodyguard. He's been with me since I was a mere girl. Served me very well, haven't you, Major?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMAJOR: We give our all, milady.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Pleased to meet you, Major.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: How are my other men?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: (aside) Other men?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Other Men in Khajiit suits)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMAJOR: All present and accounted for, milady. Had a spot of bother with what looked like a party of Merchants following you. But they are out of the picture now, down a ravine. Only one thing.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Yes?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMAJOR: Me and my men, we've been noticing sort of furtive movements, up on cliffs, on ridges -- always just out of the corners of our eyes. And we keep getting this feeling of being watched. Now, me and my men, we're the best but there's something out there. Don't like it, not one bit.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh Dear - and just when it was getting to be fun.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMAJOR: Its not anything human. Not Mages, Armorers, Priests. And its not the usual werewolves, harpies, orcs, daedra. Nothing like that, not at all.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: Dwarves!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: Where? ... oh ... Minnie ... you mean ... up ... there ... here ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... Dwarves, up there ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... How exciting ... mmmm ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... There, there, Crunn, calm down ... just dwarves ... I knew that one day they would ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... Wake up ..?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... Come back ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... But ... I didn't go anywhere ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... The dwarves, Crunn ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... Oooh ... Back ... So excited ... Dwarves! ... oooh ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Well Major, is it possible?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMAJOR: Anything's possible, especially up here. Dwarves? I don't know. Me and my men, we'll get rid of this lot. There's a good deep mine shaft out back.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit All, but the Adventurer and Contessa)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Dwarves, Ave! Is that trouble? I mean, they sort of own all the ebony down here, don't they?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Maybe. I guess we just have to push on, see what develops. I can try to talk to them, maybe? Oh, and Adventurer, you'll have to drive the first cart. I'll take old Nephron's. We'll leave the other here -- Spares for later.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: What, no more bucolic frolics?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Sorry, but we've got to get to the site and out again before the weather goes bad.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Can't your Major and his men, handle the carts?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Oh, no. They will cover us from all sides and make certain there are no surprises.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh well. All good things end, I guess.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Not quite. If you have any charges left in your bracelets of endurance, we can go upstairs and see what develops.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: Well, I guess we all saw that coming. Scene 3 takes place some time later at the site. Flanked by the Major's men, the Adventurer and the Wanton Contessa successfully follow the map of the dear, departed mages. Imagine great veins of glistening ebonyesque material piercing the surface of the ground, and a nice warm fire of Fools Ebony where the Adventurer and the Contessa sprawl. To the west are signs that the weather is turning and the first major snowstorm of the year is coming. For some time, they have been mining and the Adventurer is beginning to feel the strain of actual labor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScene 3<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: I've got blisters on my hands from shovelling that black rot, blisters on my rear from that cart bench, and we are running out of ale. My bracelet is running down and my fingers are getting frostbite.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: What, your bracelet is running down? Oh, now that is serious.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Major, running)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMAJOR: Dwarves! Milady, dwarves, dozens of the little buggers caught my men! I'm sorry, milady.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Contessa jumps to her feet)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Major, get out of here now. If you get away, you can maybe help us later. I'll try to talk to them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Major) (Enter DWARVES)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Hhjgys jjvvu klpss Jjqqx zzyzx.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDWARVES (Together): Jjpoo Kalagloo gashnoo bibloo franoo Xxnadoo<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Jnik? Balpo?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDWARVES (Together) :Gabloo! Wazzikoo! Eppapupu!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Glooky, glooky, glooky.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Ave, whats going on?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Relax. I think I've impressed them by talking their language. I don't understand everything, but it seems that they have only just 'woken up' or something. And that they will not let us take any of this Fool's Ebony -- it's somehow related to the real stuff or something. And it really belongs to the Lords of Oblivion -- the Dwarves are just care or something.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Very interesting. Now, what about us?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: I made a deal with them the only way I could see. I told them about Minnie and Crunn, how those two old ones know lots of dwarven tales and legends. The dwarves tells me that, having just 'woken up' or something, they want three things -- ale, women, and us to leave the Fools' Ebony alone.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Ah, flog my log.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Well, I told them about all the ale down at Minnie's Inn. And about the 2 redheads there. They are going there, leaving right now. We may take one empty cart, 2 horses. And they will keep us guarded all the way there. They also said that they will -- I don't know how -- destroy all the Fool's Ebony here. It shouldn't be on the surface like this, they say. (aside) Dwarvish is a remarkably compact language.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: By the great roaring buttocks of Sheogorath! All these blisters and backache for nothing! Ah well. At least we are still alive. For now ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exeunt) (Enter Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: Farnoo Lickety Kanoo Gadfloo. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. As Scene 4 begins, we are back at Minnie's Inn, where the dwarves appear to be on holiday.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter the Adventurer, the Wanton Contessa, Minnie, Crunn, and Dwarves)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScene 4<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMINNIE: ... ga ... sszx ... spnoo? ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCRUNN: ... glurky ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDWARVES (Together): Jotcha potchka lazzo lanni joopy hoopy qui me amat, amat et canem meam<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Ave, any ideas? I can't seem to work my magical items. And when the ale runs out ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Your ebony material is useless against them. Dwarves fashion the ebony, so I guess they can suppress it or something. Don't worry - just think, these dwarves have been asleep or something for hundreds of years. And Minnie has a huge stock of ale. Not many customers come this way, and she knows how to salt the ale just right to keep from spoiling for decades.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Oh, that's why my tongue always looks like a chunk of leather after a pint or two.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Dwarves apparently love ale. I expect them all to pass out in an hour or so.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Dwarves fall into comas)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: If not sooner. Come on, Adventurer. Grab a sack and start collecting! When the dwarves wake up, they'll finish the ale, and then us.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Wanton Contessa and Adventurer pillage the dwarves)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: South, as fast as our horses will take us in this weather.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: If we make enough distance before they wake up, we'll be all right - I don't think that they will leave their precious mountains. I hope not.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: The wailing wintery wind whirls wickedly, wafts whipping, wading waist-high, oh never mind. The Adventurer and the Contessa get lost in the snow storm. Several days later, we find them desperate for warmth and exhausted.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: The horses have had it. They can't go another step and its going to snow again. No ale left, and just one loaf.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: It will have to do.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Suddenly, a party of giants leaps on our hero and heroine. But after some quick work with Bracers of Firestorm, really dead giants lie around in heaps)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Anything left, Ave?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: No, no more fire anything - just my daggers<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Same here, just a common shortsword. Curse Sheogorath for those dwarves! Those oafs chewed up our horses! Do you think the Major made it out?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: If anyone can, it's him. Guess we'll find out in town. Interesting thought just occured to me. Don't giants hunt in several groups? Is that more I hear?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(sound of grumbling and gargling offstage)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Yes, there are more giants out there. Quick, Ave. Help me with this one.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Adventurer starts to disembowel a giant's body)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: What on Tamriel are you doing? This is not the time for studying anatomy!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Don't argue, climb inside!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Poppydash and Baldercock! Inside that smelly dead giant? My dear Adventurer, I'm a Lady.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: It's our only hope! The giant smell will hide our scent, and live giants never touch dead ones. Quick!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Adventurer and the Contessa climb inside the steaming giant's body)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Here, help me pull the skin shut - and try not to throw up. Don't make a sound.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: A few hour pass.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exit Prologue) (The Adventurer and the Wanton Contessa poke their heads out of the giant's belly.)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: They've all left, but it's snowing hard. Definitely getting real cold. We better stay here.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: It indeed is warm.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: It will keep us warm, safe from the storm and giants, for a day or so if we can stand the smell. Here, want some bread?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(The Contessa falls victim to nausea)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Prologue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: For this, the last scene of the play, please forgive us, but we need to change the set. Remove the \"giant corpses\" and whatnot. Please be patient while our bard performs the timeless classic \"Whither Goest Thou?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Bard plays \"Whither Goest Thou?\" If the scenarists take too long, he also plays \"For Further Consideration.\")<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPROLOGUE: Ah, here we are, back at the Dead Daedra Inn. The Contessa and the Adventurer made it, after all. They had to pay three times the normal rate, for they were very dirty and stinky. Now poor Prologue will bid you farewell, goodly people.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nScene 6<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Thank the Gods for hot water and soap! I thought I would smell like a giant forever.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Me too. Where did you go while I was bathing? And why no mages, priests, armorers, or merchants outside yelling for our blood?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: I took a quick trip to the Palace. I've fixed it so some cousins have told the armorers and merchants that we don't have cartloads of the Fools' Ebony.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Pity that that's actually true.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: But at least no one's interested in us anymore. Seems that some priests turned up dead in an old temple, up on Edward's Mountain. They were found with some girl, all dead from 'bad green powder' or something. And some old mages named Shub have gone missing ...<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: Now then, what did you stuff in those sacks thats so important?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Here, dump them out, take a look.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: By the Gods, just look at that!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Yes, those dwarves were just loaded with ebony. Look. Rings, torcs, bracers, belts, helms All solid old ebony.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER: And this stuff feels just loaded with magicka. Why, I bet that this ring alone has a thousand uses... whatever it does.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCONTESSA: Ooh! Look! Bracers of Extreme Endurance and a Belt of Strength! Put them on, Adventurer, let's celebrate!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nADVENTURER (aside): Help!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Enter Epilogue)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEPILOGUE: As I feared, all the loose threads of the play were ended by wholesale slaughter. More of the adventures of the Adventurer will follow, unless, of course, they don't. We thank you for your tempered patience. Don't forget to tip your worthy wenches on your way out this evening, and enjoy our bard's rendition of the Khajiiti classic, \"It's A Matter of Luck.\" Goodnight.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Flourish)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n(Exeunt Omnes)<BR>"

Perhaps it is purely apocryphal, but when I was told it, it was whispered in such a way that it was meant to be taken seriously. Not having any children of my own to whisper to, and being in need of some gold, I have elected to publish my story.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe asylum my great great uncle worked in was apparently very posh. Only the right class of lunatics were admitted. Eccentric dukes, mad baronesses, touched lords, and daft ladies filled the asylums tapestried and gilded halls. Still, it was a time of great excitement when the rumor began that the unhinged Emperor of Tamriel, Pelagius III, was transferring there from a resort in Valenwood. When the rumor became a reality, the asylum went into nice, calm, restive chaos. Pelagius was given an entire wing of the asylum for his own use, for, though he was madder than a jackal, he was still His Terrible Majesty, the Emperor of Tamriel.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Emperor was remarkably well behaved, my great great uncle supposedly asserted. Of course, he did not have to face the commoners who came on all sorts of pretenses to gawk at their overlord, the loon. When one of the warders (not, I have been assured, my uncle) forgot himself and let His Terrible Majesty know that people had been there to see him, the Emperor grew very excited. He made up his mind right there and then to have a ball. A huge party with musicians, dancing, and dinner, right at the lunatic asylum. Or precisely, in his wing of the asylum.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRumors of the Emperor's interest in holding a ball spread throughout Torval and eventually it reached the ears of the Emperess Regent Katariah, Pelagius' dear wife, in the Imperial City. Eager to make her husband happy, she sent a caravan laden with gold to the asylum so a ball might be held befitting the Imperial dignity.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Emperor picked a date for the ball, and preparations began immediately. The old asylum walls were beautifully decorated, but needed cleaning. A pit had to be constructed to house the orchestra; servants for cooking and serving the food had to be hired; gold and ebony candelabras and matching chandeliers were ordered; the old rugs were destroyed, and new rugs embroidered with gems were weaved; lists of guests had to be compiled, reconsidered and recompiled. The Emperor knew that the guest list had to be very exclusive, and he relied on his advisors to tell him who was alive, who was dead, and who was imaginary.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe party was set to begin at nine o'clock. At six, the hairdresser he had hired from Torval finished his Imperial coiffure. At seven, he was fully dressed in the robes he had ordered for the ball: voluminous black silk and piled velvet crusted with red diamonds. At eight, he walked down the newly reconstructed staircase to supervise the final preparations -- the lighting of the candles, the opening of the wine, the murder of the first course. At nine o'clock, he took his seat at the facsimile throne he had ordered and awaited the first guests.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt nine thirty, his advisor, seeing the royal eyes beginning to glaze over with madness, said, \"Your Terrible Majesty surely knows that it is not fashionable to arrive at any ball for at least an hour after the desired time, yes?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Emperor just stared.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt ten thirty, the Emperor called for some food and wine, and sat at his throne, looking at the open door, eating. Thirty minutes later, he ordered the orchestra to begin playing. For the next three hours, they played gaily for the empty, candlelit ballroom.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt one o'clock, the Emperor announced his intention to retire for the evening. My uncle was one of the warders who assisted His Terrible Majesty up the staircase. Halfway to his room, Pelagius threw himself on the floor in a hysteria, screaming and laughing, ordering more wine (my mother was good at this part of the story, rolling her eyes and shrieking, \"More wine! More wine! Wine!\"), and, in short, imagining that he was possessed by all the revellers at his party that never was.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTwo days later, he was still not better. He had cut himself and those who tried to grapple him horribly with the red diamonds of his robe. Eventually it was decided that the Torval asylum was not equipped to deal with a lunatic of his severity, and he was sent to a more secure location in Black Marsh. It was only three months later, my uncle heard that the Emperor had died.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOne of my uncle's duties was to clear out the personal property of the inmates after their death. Being primarily landed nobility, the personal property was often quite extensive. Several years after the asylum ball, my uncle was called to clear out the apartment of a duchess whose chief eccentricity was a propensity to pilfer. Kleptomania, I believe it's called. Locked away in a secret door in her desk, protected by a trap armed with a barbed needle, was a variety of jewels, piles of gold, and a five large stacks of beautifully engraved invitations signed in the Emperor's childlike handwriting.<BR>\r\n<BR>"

Every drop of it.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThat's how he greeted me. I said nothing at first. Foroch's brewery was high in the trees, and I had just climbed the Great Spiral all the way around from the dirt below. \"I just. Stopped. To say. Goodbye. Because.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I know it. You're off to Cyrodiil to get your education. You just dropped in for a bit of ale before leaving, is that it? Well, they took every drop of it, so there's no use begging a mug from me.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI didn't contradict him. I was still panting, and he was right. I came to see him for one last taste of his fine summer ale.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"But if you want to take a keg to that fancy studium of yours, I might have a deal for you.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Didn't you say it was stolen?\" I asked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I did say that, because it was stolen,\" said Foroch. \"But if you can get it back, I'll let you take a keg of it. They didn't take my regular ale. They took the Sun's Dusk ale.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I don't believe I've ever had the pleasure of that one,\" I said.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Few have, for the brewing of it is a trying task. It takes years for all the meat and bugs to fall in. And--\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Bugs?\" I asked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"You can't just go dumping them in, you know,\" Foroch said, \"they have to fall naturally. Crosswings have a fierce bitterness when they die afraid. First, you must stretch seventeen strings of Alfiq-gut over each barrel. Then you must press fresh boar meat onto the strings, being careful not to let any fall before it has properly rotted. Then you must dust the meat with the finely chopped skins of the red-striped frog to make sure the crosswings are drunk and happy when they fall. You do this every month for three or more years, until you have enough meat and bugs to fill the barrel. And that's not even counting the enchantments. You have spells to attract the crosswings and mimics. And spells to keep out the flipbacks, tree-hoppers, and hoarvor young. There are spells to encourage the green mold and prevent the brown and white molds. Then you have to seal the barrel for nine or more years until the last of the green mold turns--\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"It sounds very difficult,\" I said, preferring ignorance when it came to Green Pact brewing. \"Do you know who took it?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"It was those filthy, miserable Imga,\" spat Foroch. \"Six kegs I had. They're the only ones who could carry a keg over each shoulder. And the brewery stinks of them.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI knew which Imga he was talking about. Boff's band. \"Aren't they in their clearing? Why don't you round up a few mer and take it back?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I can see you've no proper understanding of the matter. I can't talk with them. I'm the proper owner, so seeing them would acknowledge the theft. You Bretons are half elven, or so they say. Imga will listen to you.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Why me? I've lived here a few years, but I'll always be an outsider,\" I said.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Perfect.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I only know what you just told me,\" I said.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Perfect.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"And as you just pointed out, I don't fully understand the situation,\" I said, desperately.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Perfect.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThat's how I got the job.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI walked the Great Spiral all the way back down and set out towards the Imga's clearing. As a Breton living in Valenwood, I often saw things from an unusual perspective. Namely, the forest floor. The Bosmer around Greenheart rarely went all the way to the ground, unless they planned on leaving the city. This had a few unfortunate consequences, I thought, when I tripped over a deer antler jutting out above the other garbage. Since the Bosmer rarely visited the ground, they had no qualms about throwing their trash down from the treetops and forgetting about it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI knew I was getting close to the Imga's clearing when I heard the drumming. This was a bad sign. They usually only got out the drums when they'd been drinking. I hoped they still had some of Foroch's ale left.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen I got in sight of the clearing, I waited patiently for the end of their impromptu concert. I'd never be an admirer, but there was something to be said for their music. What the Imga lacked in rhythm, they made up for in enthusiasm. Pickler saw me first and stopped beating the hollow log he'd almost mashed down to pulp. \"What is that terrible smell?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I do believe it's a man, Pickler,\" said Boff.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Indeed. It has that spoiled milk odor,\" said Noggin, the last member of Boff's clan.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Boff,\" I said. \"It's been a long time.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Duke Boff to you, nemer,\" he said, as he adjusted his cloak and pulled himself up to this full height.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Of course, Duke Boff,\" I said quickly. \"Forgive me. The long journey has left me without any graces.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"You're lucky I'm in such a forgiving mood today,\" said the Duke. \"What brings you to my lands?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"My Lord, I heard that you acquired some of Foroch's ale.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Oh?\" Boff asked. \"Do you want it? I might be looking for a buyer.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I take it there's still some left, then?\" Perhaps this journey wasn't wasted after all.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Duke Boff, slowly. \"We haven't finished it yet.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Why don't we give him a taste?\" Pickler asked, with a grin.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"That sounds like a fine idea, Pickler. Fetch one of the kegs.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI watched as Pickler lumbered off into the forest, but he passed out of sight before I could see where the kegs were hidden. He returned carrying a keg so effortlessly that I flinched when he slammed it on the ground. Obviously, the keg was still nearly full. He produced a wooden bowl and worked the tap just enough for a few swallows of ale, crinkling his wide nose as he poured.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI took the bowl and sniffed it. I've heard that some connoisseurs judge ales and wines by their aroma, but with Bosmer drinks, this is simply a wise precaution. The Sun's Dusk Ale smelled nothing like Foroch's summer ale. Nor did it resemble the less palatable Bosmer drinks, such as Jagga, which has a truly unique odor. It smelled, if anything, like a juicy steak marinated with plum wine and coriander. I took a sip and gently closed my eyes. It was dreams of flying. It was the breathless moment of my first kiss. It was a gentle fire that brought a deep smile to my face. It was happiness, distilled.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen I recovered my senses I said, \"Frostfire! What is this?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"That's what I said,\" said Pickler.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"No, Pickler, you said, 'By the rotted and flaking third claw of Herma Mora, what is this putrid filth?'\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPutrid filth? I couldn't believe my ears. This ale was surely a gift from the gods!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"As bad as it is,\" said Noggin, \"I can't see why Foroch won't let us have a taste.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"He did it just to spite us, Noggin,\" said Duke Boff. \"He never gives us the respect we deserve. He always has some excuse to ignore the old deal.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"What does this taste like to you?\" I asked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Bitter,\" said Boff.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Rotten,\" said Pickler.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"It's like that stuff that comes out when you squash a crosswing between your fingers,\" said Noggin.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Boff. \"I hope the winds pick up tonight and carry the stench away from my lands.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Hm,\" I said. \"Boff? Would you return the ale if Foroch says you're allowed to have some?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Duke Boff to you,\" said the Duke automatically. \"I wouldn't want my subjects in Greenheart to think that I am a harsh ruler. If Foroch says we can have some of the ale, he can have all the kegs back.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"It's the principle of the thing,\" said Noggin.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Duke Boff,\" I asked, \"can you have these back at Foroch's by midnight?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Sure, we can do that,\" said the Duke. \"And then we can listen to Foroch say we can have the Sun's Dusk Ale anytime we want.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"It's a deal,\" I said. \"I need to hurry back to Foroch. I fear he may take some convincing.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nForoch was waiting for me at the entrance of the brewery. His crossed arms and scowl didn't bode well. \"I see you're back,\" he said, \"and without my Sun's Dusk ale. Well, I'm not giving you any of the summer ale. Not when--\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"The Imga,\" I panted.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I send you out on a simple job--\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Should be.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"And you dare to come here--\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Bringing it back.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Empty handed--\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"By midnight.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Without even an apology! No, the first words out of your mouth were... Did you say the Imga are bringing it tonight?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"How much is left?\" asked Foroch.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Almost all of it, I believe. I think they only tapped one of the kegs.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Excellent,\" said Foroch, getting out a couple of mugs. \"This calls for a celebration.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Wait,\" I said. \"Wait. Please. I need to explain the terms.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Terms? Your words fill me with dread,\" said Foroch as he swiftly put the mugs away. \"What did you promise the filthy Imga?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"That you would let them have as much of the Sun's Dusk as they wanted, once they--\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Wha... You... Why... If I... How could...\" For once, Foroch was speechless.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Wait,\" I said. \"Let me explain.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI had no chance to explain until nearly midnight. Foroch, who soon regained the gift of speech, ranted and raved about me, the Imga, and our common ancestors until he nearly lost his voice. When Foroch finally wound down, I tried to explain again. \"The Imga won't ask for much ale,\" I said.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Won't! Won't! Have you never drunk with an Imga? Their thirst is legendary. The Abecean Sea wouldn't sate them.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"They don't like the ale,\" I said.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Insult to injury! Now they criticize my ale after stealing it.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Listen,\" I said. \"They won't drink much of the ale because they hate the stuff. That's why they didn't tap any of the other kegs.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Maybe there is some sense in your plan after all,\" Foroch rasped. \"But, still, to give the Sun's Dusk to the Imga...\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"You'll have to if you want any of it back,\" I said. \"If you think it's bad for them to steal it, imagine them dumping the barrels in the river while they pinch their noses.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"There are precedent and principles, you see. We've lived together since the days of Aldmeris. And now, having lost our empire, our honor, our rights and dignities, now a man asks me to break traditions older than the arrival of men. To break traditions the filthy Imga half remember and rarely obeyed. There are times, Rascien, when I must say that I hate you men nearly as much as I hate the Imga and the Khajiit.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI was shocked. Not at the sentiment, for it was common in Valenwood, but that it was spoken so plainly. \"In all the years I've lived here,\" I said, \"I've never heard--\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I said it, and I meant it,\" said Foroch, staring into his mug. \"And we'll not speak of it again.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOur silence was broken by the arrival of the Imga and the ale.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nForoch stood unsteadily. \"So you've brought me a gift, have you?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"No gift, Foroch,\" said Boff. \"This is the ale we rightfully stole and--\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Rightfully?! Rightfully?!\" spat Foroch.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Imga interrupted Foroch's fast-approaching rant by slamming the kegs on the floor, shaking the entire brewery and knocking a few mugs off the shelves.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBoff placed his elbows on a keg and leaned forward. \"I want to hear it, Foroch. I want to hear the whole formal thing.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Not on your life,\" said Foroch, backing away. \"You ask too much, Boff.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Duke Boff to you, Bosmer.\" Boff's mouth hung open, as if he was surprised by his own words.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nForoch went speechless again. He grinded his teeth together and glared at me. I whispered, \"Think of the ale, Foroch. Think of the ale.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I, Foroch,\" he spat, \"acknowledge that you fil... you lyi... chea.... mis... That you, Duke Boff, R-Rightfully stole these barrels and that...\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"And from now on we can have as much of this ale as we want, having rightfully stolen it.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"And from now on,\" said Foroch through clenched teeth. \"You may have. As much. Ale. As you want.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBoff held out his hand. Foroch stared at it a full minute before shaking it hastily.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"How about a mug all around to close the deal?\" I asked. I couldn't resist.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Maybe just a swallow,\" said Boff. I could almost see him turning green beneath his fur.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nForoch scowled the whole time he poured. Boff scowled the whole time he drank. And me? I sipped the best brew in all Tamriel and smiled.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy smile didn't fade until halfway to Silvenar when I discovered that the keg Foroch gave me was the tapped one and already half empty.<BR>\r\n<BR>"

Thankfully, the shrub only thrives in the mineral rich soil of the ashlands. However, First Era chimer alchemists observed that the thorns of the trama root secrete a non-lethal, but poisonous sap that causes lethargy and lightheadedness in the afflicted. Some of these symptoms were traced back to the trama root’s -previously unknown- natural levitative properties. After this discovery, trama root quickly became a desirable ingredient especially among what would become the modern day Telvanni settlements where levitation is a staple of everyday life. But the trama shrub’s affinity for growing in ashy soil continued to be an inconvenient limitation for many farmers until the Telvanni found that the cut trama thorns could be grafted into nearly any woodlike material. The foreign trama would then grow like a parasite on its host plant, but lacked the ability to spread at any concerning rate into the unideal soil around it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis led to speculation regarding how trama processes the mineral rich soil in the ashlands since it could inherit comparatively mineral poor nutrients from its grafted host but could not distill it on its own in the same soil. Experts still disagree on the subject, but the most popular explanation is that trama roots supplement their more mundane nutritional needs by draining magical essence from the soil itself. When grafted to another plant, the trama root can feed on the magical essence of the host as a substitute for what it otherwise draws from the salts of the ashlands - but obviously with decreased efficacy. It is common knowledge that crystalline ash salt possesses storative properties similar to many other morpholithic crystals but there aren’t many documented practical applications. Ashlanders use ash salts in their dream rituals and believe that the salt crystals contain memories of what they call the “Red Moment” - their folktales spin a tale of trama roots feeding on the painful memories of that time. But as with many other Ashlander legends and prophecies, this belief is not founded on any tangible evidence.<BR>\r\n<BR>"
