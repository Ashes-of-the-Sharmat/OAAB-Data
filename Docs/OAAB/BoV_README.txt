	Books of Vvardenfell
	version 2.41

	by Stuporstar
*****************************************************************
	REQUIRES: Tribunal
*****************************************************************
This simple mod adds over 50 new lore-friendly books to Morrowind.

However, these are not just guide books designed to make stuff easier to look up while you play the game (though they serve that purpose well).
Each book has its own author, a person who exists somewhere in Nirn (not necessarily in Vvardenfell, but some authors are existing NPCs).
As such, I tried to write each book with the author's particular voice in mind.
Some authors have their own biases, and are not necessarily 100% accurate depictions of the game world, but rather colored through that author's particular lens.

Includes:

Alchemical Information:

- Alchemy for Beginners: pretty self explanatory. "Written by" Madame Mary Madrigal, an Altmer alchemist.
- The Complete Alchemists Compendium: as a single book and in a five volume set. Also by Madame Mary Madrigal.
- The Vvardenfell Flora Compendium: as a single volume and also a six volume set. By Madame Mary Madrigal.
- The Flora of Mournhold: single volume. By Madame Mary Madrigal.
- The Special Flora of Soltheim: single volume. By Madame Mary Madrigal.
- The Fauna of Vvardenfell: detailing some of the creatures of Morrowind. By Edras Oril.
- The Hunter's Guild to Soltheim: detailing the creatures in the Bloodmoon expansion. By Halgren the Hunter.
- A series of single page alchemy recipes by Madame Mary Madrigal.
- A Mineralogical Survey of Vvardenfell: by The East Empire Company

World Information:

- Alvo's Book of Blight Diseases: By Endthenal Alvo.
- Alvo's Book of Common Diseases: By Endthenal Alvo.
- Cosmos, by Carlenus Saganus: a book on the Cosmology of Nirn.
- A Complete Traveler's Guide to Vvardenfell: A book detailing the regions and major cities of the island, written by an Imperial author named Orwil Endarr. This book is also available in a four volume set consisting of the Hlaalu, Telvanni, Redoran and Temple controlled regions, as well as a book on general tips for the traveler.
- The Traveler's Guide to Vvardenfell: Another book in the series by Orwil Endarr containing useful tips for the traveler; Mentioned here separately because it contains some practical tips that the Complete Guide didn't have room to cover.
- Maps of Vvardenfell: A complete series of maps of every region, major city, and travel routes.
- The Book of Lesser Daedra: A treatise by Omavyl Rhea of the Tribunal Temple.
- Buoyant Armiger's Survey of the Daedric Shrines in Vvardenfell
- The Key to the Dunmer Strongholds: By Folms Mirel
- The Imperial Historical Society Handbook on the Excavation of Dwemer Ruins in Morrowind, Volume I: Vvardenfell
- The Tribunal Temple Tomb Registry: a book containing a list of ancestral tombs maintained by the Tribunal Temple.
- Verena's Guide to Enchanting: a book on enchanting by the Telvanni Verena Uvirith.
- Daedric for Dunmer: an alphabet book for Dunmer children by the Tribunal Temple.

Role-playing:

- The Armorer's Handbook: by Charles Alton Wayn. These come in three volumes, one for each class of armor by weight. These are not basic game guides to armor. These teach you how to MAKE armor. These methods, for the most part, are real. As a trained jeweler, I have some experience in these techniques, and have researched the rest. Includes illustrations of tools, chain mail patterns, and plate armor.
- The Blacksmith's Complete Handbook: by Charles Alton Wayn. This book will teach you how to create weapons, including complete western and eastern sword making techniques. Includes a full color plate of a steel temperature diagram.
- The Book of Secrets: a book about secrets, author unknown. This book is by Jac.
- Dangerous Places and How to Avoid Them! Volume VI: Vvardenfell, by Ansel the Craven Adventurer: This is the complete antithesis of an in-game guide. It contains the most unhelpful information ever, such as "completely avoid Ashlanders," or "Stick with the Imperial Cult, because the Tribunal Temple are crazies who like to send pilgrims to the most evil places on Nirn just to go have a looksee."
- Imperial Egg Mining: A Tract by Uther Orandus to the Imperial Empire.
- Pack Guars, Our Faithful Friends: a book about taming, raising, and training guars
- The Spirits of Vvardenfell: by Andren Belecosta. A book on all the local alcohols in Morrowind and how they're made..
- A Traveller's Guide to Orcs: by Deandre. An entertaining view on Orcs written by Jac.
- Bloatspore cultivation: this is originally a quest reward from Uvirith's Legacy. Because of this, the upcoming version of UL will disable this book until the quest is complete if UL is loaded (because the author hasn't written it yet). Otherwise it will be fully available for non-UL players.
- A Traveller's Guide to Bretons: by Deandre. An entertaining view on Bretons written by Jac.

Fiction, Poetry, etc.

- An Affair of Bards: by the Breton Bard Deandre. A romance book written by Jac.
- Common Jokes and Riddles: A collection of jokes and riddles commonly told throughout Tamriel. Author(s) unknown.
- Crude Jokes and Riddles: Collected and published by Crassius Curio.
- Crassius' Crude Limericks: Collected and published by Crassius Curio.
- Ol' Uncle Crassius' Collection of Bedtime Stories: A book of somewhat bawdy tales.
- Dibella's Whispers: A book of love poetry that is somewhat erotic in nature, but by no means crude. Written by the Breton Bard Deandre (actually written Jac from the PES forums).
- The Most Colourful Insults of the Dunmer: a book of collected insults and witty retorts.
- The Sayings of Tamriel: a book of collected sayings of the various peoples of Tamriel.
- The Tale of the White Guar: an old Ashlander tale adapted by the Tribunal Temple.
- Nord Drinking Songs: by the Breton Bard Deandre (Jac).


This version includes new textures, meshes and icons for all of the books, as well as some book art for some of the volumes.
Each book has its own unique cover, much in the style of the Book Jackets mod which includes titles (or at the very least something unique to differentiate it) on every spine so that the player can easily see what books they have on their shelves without having to mouse-over all of them.
I've also included icons which resemble the jackets of each book so you can easily see them amongst Jobasha's massive selection in the barter window, and so you can easily pick them out of your inventory.
Some of these books contain illustrations. Maps of Vvardenfell in particular is entirely composed of book art.
These books also contain their own version of the Book Rotate scripting, so they work with or without Book Rotate installed.

*****************************************************************
Book Locations:

Vivec: Jobasha's Rare Books. Jobasha has the complete collection of books from this mod, excluding the individual alchemy recipes.
Vivec: Simine Fralinie. Simine is not strong competition for Jobasha, but she does have a small selection of these books. Great if you want duplicate sets of all the alchemy volumes available to fill a second library or alchemy lab.
Balmora: Dorisa Darvel. Has a small selection of books including Alchemy for Beginners, and Maps of Vvardenfell.
Ald'ruhn: Codus Callonus: Has a modest selection of books including all of the individual alchemy recipes not found anywhere else.

The Tribunal Tomb Registry is found in the Temple's secret library. It cannot be taken.
	However, there is a small quest involving a copy of the book available to members of the Tribunal Temple.
	For non-members of the Temple, carrying the book is a severe crime should you find it and be caught with it, so beware.

*****************************************************************
Installation:

Standard, just unzip into data files. Make sure to copy all of the meshes, textures, icons and book art into their respective folders.

Specifically submissions by Eevle and Aanar
<http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/PC/Morrowind/faqs.html>

This mod also makes use of the Book Rotate Script from Heph's Book Rotate Mod 5.3
<http://www.heph.org/morrowind>

Quotes from Carl Sagan's Cosmos were used in Cosmos.

Spririts of Vvardenfell was edited and had ideas contributed by DebiDalio.


Copyedited by Bigsmoke. Re-edited by me for clarity and brevity in 2012.

Thanks to Gez for proofreading version 2.2.


Illustrations:

All interior illustrations were hand drawn by me.

Maps of Vvardenfell includes hand drawn copies of the original game maps.

The steel color chart in The Complete Blacksmith has been modified from a book on metallurgy.

The alembic illustration in Spirits of Vvardenfell is copied by hand from an 18th century illustration.

The Dwemer Orrery and star chart illustrations are copied from The Academy of Dwemer Studies.

The Aurbis illustration was inspired by Melchior Dark's map of the Aurbis and medieval woodcut illustrations.


Meshes and Textures:

All of the textures and icons were created by me.

A few of the new book jackets make use of some of the textures from William The Taffer's Better Books, though I've altered all of them significantly.

Melian's book mesh and related book rotate scripting are used in the Guide to Vvardenfell series and the Complete Vvardenfell Flora Compendium.

Shwaa's scroll meshes were used for all alchemy recipe scrolls.

You can contact me with any feedback at SarahDiMento@Gmail.com or find me on the TES forums as Stuporstar.

If anyone would like to contribute to this mod in any way, please feel free to contact me.

*****************************************************************
If you would like to use any of these books in your own mod (such as a compilation or library), feel free to do so. If you want to make modifications to the books, contact me about it first.
MAKE SURE TO CREDIT THESE BOOKS BY THEIR REAL AUTHOR. Those books which aren't written by me are listed in the credits above.
I'd also appreciate dropping a link to this mod in your readme if you decide to use it. I do not expect other modders to keep up with every update, and I would at least like to make people aware of new books that are available.

Feel free to use some of the book textures as base textures for your own books, but please alter them significantly if you do so.
I want the book covers in BoV to be unique in the game, so please don't use these textures and icons unaltered for your own books.
If you want a unique book cover for a book in your own mod, you can also contact me and ask me to make one for you if you're not up to texturing one yourself. I enjoy making book covers, so I would be happy to help whenever I have spare time.
